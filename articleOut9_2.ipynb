Tare  March 13, 2020 ISSUE DATE: March 23, 2020UPDATED: March 13, 2020 13:10 IST  Goodies galore (From right): Ajit Pawar, Uddhav Thackeray and MoS for finance Shambhuraje Desai arrive to present the 2020-21 budget. (Photo: Mandar Deodhar)Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray looked visibly pleased as Deputy Chief Minister and Finance Minister Ajit Pawar presented the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government\\'s first budget on March 6. Four sectors that Thackeray has long supported -- agriculture, urban development, transport and tourism -- have all received significant consideration.The state budget estimates total expenditure at Rs 1.15 lakh crore, of which close to 40 per cent -- about Rs 42,588 crore -- will be spent on social and community services. Another Rs 16,333 crore has been allocated to agriculture and allied services, while the transport department, overseen by the Shiv Sena\\'s Anil Parab, has got Rs 16,846 crore. This is almost Rs 800 crore more than the crucial water resources department, headed by the Nationalist Congress Party\\'s Jayant Patil. The government has also announced a 1 per cent stamp duty concession for two years in urban pockets, including the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Nagpur. This, it is hoped, will go some way in reviving sales in the real estate sector, which is overseen by the Sena\\'s Eknath Shinde. Thackeray\\'s focus on social welfare is evident in two schemes -- loan waiver to farmers (which gets Rs 22,000 crore; Rs 15,000 crore in 2019-20 and Rs 7,000 crore in 2020-21) and the Shiv Bhojan meal at Rs 10. The latter scheme, which has been allocated Rs 150 crore, has been an instant hit since its launch on January 26. The government has now doubled the daily number of plates served to 36,000 from 18,000 across 148 centres in the state and says it plans to increase that number to 100,000 per day. \"The response to this scheme has been overwhelming,\" says food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal.The opposition has derided the \"freebie\" culture inherent in power minister Nitin Raut\\'s plan to provide free electricity up to 100 units to domestic consumers. But he is determined to continue with the AAP government-inspired plan. A committee of three secretaries has been set up to chalk out a proposal.In keeping with the Sena\\'s core bel\\xadiefs, learning Marathi is now compulsory in all boards till Standard 10. \"Syllabus evaluations will be our priority in the future,\" says school education minister Varsha Gaikwad, from the Congress.The environment has always been a big priority of the Thackerays, and the chief minister\\'s son and minister for environment and tourism, Aaditya Thackeray, has big plans. This includes a dedicated \\'Green Fund\\', and promoting free \\'forest walks\\' in areas other than wildlife reserves. \"I am in talks with the forest department to make it a reality,\" says Aaditya. His department will also get Rs 1,000 crore for a world-class aquarium to be constructed in Worli, his constituency. Mumbai also gets an annual Rs 100 crore for the development of tourism infrastructure.Chief Minister Thackeray has reiterated that his government\\'s commitment is to make people\\'s lives comfortable. However, Devendra Fadnavis, leader of the opposition, says Thackeray is leading a \"stay government\" -- a dig at Uddhav\\'s decision to put on hold some projects initiated in Fadnavis\\'s time.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

(Photo: Subir Halder)Chhatradhar Mah\\xadato, once the face of the People\\'s Committee against Police Atrocities (PCPA), an overground outfit of the Maoists in Bengal, was rel\\xade\\xadased on February 1. One of the accused in an abortive attempt to blow up Left Front chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee\\'s convoy in November 2008, he was arr\\xadested In September 2009.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was then leader of the Opposition, and Mahato\\'s release was a const\\xadant chant as the Trinamool Con\\xadgress (TMC) worked with the PCPA in the tribal belt to unseat the Left. But that was then. Mamata has been in power since 2011, but it took her till now to keep her promise.During this time, despite the pleas and intimidatory tactics of the Maoists and even Mahato\\'s wife Niyati\\'s ultimatum to contest from the area on a Samajwadi Party ticket, nothing moved Mamata. Things started changing after the 2018 panchayat poll. The BJP won 42 per cent of the vote in Jhargram and 33 per cent in Purulia in that election. A year later, the Lok Sabha results saw the BJP sweep five (Purulia, Jhargram, Bankura, Bishnupur, Medinipur) of the six Lok Sabha constituencies in this belt, which sent alarm bells ringing in the TMC. In the context of the assembly, this would count for 42 seats.The TMC realised that they needed a tribal face to win back the tribal ST vote (29 per cent), and who better than the legendary Mahato, who was in jail for leading a people\\'s movement against the police and administration. Files started moving to commute Mahato\\'s life term and the government made overtures to ensure the loyalty of the family. His two sons were given government jobs as well.Word has got around that Mahato might join the TMC and that he has thanked Mamata for the development work in the Jangalmahal area (the erstwhile Maoist belt including West Medinipur, Purulia, Bankura and Jhargram). TMC spokesperson and minister Partha Chatterjee has publicly said that Mahato was welcome, though the man himself says he will decide when \"the time is right. As of now, I am trying to get a feel of the situation\".The TMC thinks Mahato could be their saviour, but people on the ground, like Krishna Murmu of the Bharat Jakat Manjhi Pargana Mahal (an outfit of the Santhals), think otherwise. \"The tribals feel Mamata has betrayed them. We elected her hoping for good governance, but she let loose her corrupt leaders on us. We (tribals) got nothing, whereas even hardcore Maoists were rehabilitated with fat comp\\xadensation packages and given jobs,\" he says. BJP state president Dilip Ghosh has weighed in as well, and sees Mahato\\'s release as a TMC conspiracy to unleash the Maoists on his party.So, can Mahato help the TMC? His influence is limited to the Jhargram LS constituency -- seven assembly seats including his hometown Lalgarh. What might work is his tragic hero image -- that of a law-abiding citizen dragged into politics when the Maoists needed an honest face for their front office. Chhatradhar\\'s brother is slain Maoist leader Sasha\\xaddhar, so he was a nat\\xadural choice. Now, after a decade in jail, he is again being pushed into politics, this time because the TMC wants it as the price of his freedom.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

(Photo: Subir Halder)The forthcoming Rajya Sabha election has presented the Congress and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in West Bengal a fresh opportunity to strengthen their state-level \\'alliance\\' against the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the BJP. The two parties, which had been locked in negotiations on a consensus candidate for one of the five Rajya Sabha seats from the state, have agreed on the candidature of CPI(M) nominee and former Kolkata mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya. The other four seats will go to the TMC on the basis of its strength in the state assembly.Initially, the Congress had favoured CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury as the joint candidate, but his party said its norms disallowed members from being nominated for a third Rajya Sabha term. Yechury has been Rajya Sabha MP for consecutive terms between 2005 and 2017. The Left had turned down Yechury\\'s candidature, proposed by the Congress, on two previous occasions as well.Throughout the stalemate, though, state leaders from both sides were determined to make things work. \"If not Yechury, it should be some other mutually agreeable candidate. We cannot allow the TMC to win the fifth vacant [Rajya Sabha] seat,\" a senior Congress leader from Bengal said, requesting anonymity. The leader was referring to 2018 when the Congress had to take the TMC\\'s help to send Abhishek Singhvi to the Rajya Sabha. Apart from Bhattacharya, two other names were floated by the Left for the March 26 Rajya Sabha poll -- former MP Mohammed Salim and retired Supreme Court judge Asok Kumar Ganguly.The 2019 Lok Sabha election rout has seen the Congress and Left join forces in Bengal. In the past 10 months, the two sides have held joint street protests against the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) and the NRC (National Register of Citizens), the withdrawal of Kashmir\\'s special status and the communal violence in Delhi. They have been putting out joint resolutions in the state assembly and even addressing the media side by side. \"We are together and are looking at electoral seat adjustments. The idea is to offer Bengal an alternative to the BJP and the TMC, which are dividing the people for votes,\" says CPI(M) central committee member Robin Deb.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Menon     Telangana March 6, 2020 ISSUE DATE: March 16, 2020UPDATED: March 6, 2020 11:24 IST  Jaganmohan ReddyOn February 24, Chittoor’s first additional district judge, M. Venkata Harinath, awarded the death sentence to Mohammed Rafi, 27, for the rape and murder of a five-year-old girl at Angallu village, near Madanapalle, on November 7 last year. A 100 member police team tracked down and arrested Rafi 10 days after the crime, while he was trying to escape to Chhattisgarh. The charge-sheet was filed 17 days after the arrest, and the trial completed 90 days after that .Keen to broadcast his government’s steps to speed up judicial closure of crimes against women, Chief Minister Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy says, It has taken eight years to punish the offenders in the Nirbhaya case, but under the Andhra Pradesh Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2019, offenders will be punished in less than a month. To be sure, there is a need for swift action in such cases, as proved by the overjoyed public reaction to the encounter killing of the four accused of the rape and murder of a 27-year-old veterinarian on November 27 last year in Hyderabad.To this end, the state administration has earmarked 18 police stations, one in each police unit, to exclusively investigate heinous crimes and crimes against women and children. These stations have adequate staff half of whom are women and have been incentivised with 30 per cent additional pay to ensure efficiency and timeliness. The forensic capabilities of the state have also been beefed up to provide technical support to these investigations, and one court in each district has been dedicated to fast-tracking such trials. A mobile-based app has also been launched for such crimes to be reported without delay.This has already led to a spurt in recorded offences. Between December 13 last year when the legislation, also known as the Andhra Pradesh Disha Bill, 2019, was adopted and the end of February 2020, there has been a 39 per cent increase in reported crimes, compared to the same period in 2018-19. Charge-sheets have been filed within seven days in 53 such cases, and trials have commenced in 20. Our experience of the past two months is that both the expectation and the standards of police performance and delivery have been raised, with [the government’s initiatives] creating a holistic ecosystem that makes delivering speedy justice possible, says the state’s director general of police Gautam Sawang.Meanwhile, the new law is awaiting the President’s assent. It provides for death sentences for the offences of rape and gang-rape, and mandates the completion of trials within 21 days. Investigations are to be completed in seven days in cases where there is conclusive evidence, with trials to be concluded in 14 working days. It also prescribes life imprisonment for other sexual offences against women and children. Those found guilty can appeal to the higher courts within 60 days after the special court pronounces the verdict, with the higher courts required to announce their final decision within 45 working days. The lawyers’ fees for victims will be paid by the government.The state’s record when it comes to women’s safety is mixed. National Crime Records Bureau data for 2018 reveals that in state rankings of crime rates, Andhra Pradesh is 11 in recorded crimes against women, #25 in registered rapes and #30 in crimes against children. It is hoped that the new law will improve this record and that other states will also take note. The new law instills a sense of fear among anti-social elements and the stringent provisions needs to replicated, says Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, who led a team to Amaravati for a first-hand appraisal of the new measures. Delhi and Odisha are among the other states said to have shown interest.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Khan, a former Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) students union president like Kanhaiya, insisted later that their presence there was only to support the cause, the rally was part of a campaign against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the proposed-then-denied National Register of Citizens (NRC) but he did admit the opposition needed every like-minded party and individual on board if it was to best the JD(U)-led NDA all\\xadiance in the assembly election this October.The CPI was not part of the RJD-led five-party alliance for the Lok Sabha poll in 2019. In fact, the RJD had put up a candidate, Tanveer Hassan, in Begusarai, from where Kanhaiya contested unsucc\\xadessfully. The RJD may not be keen, but when it comes to Kanhaiya, the Congress appears to have a soft corner for the ex-student leader. If the two do come together, as some sections are hoping, it could benefit both parties in Bihar. While the CPI does not have a party organisation or a significant cadre base, the Congress lacks a frontline leader, a credible face in Bihar. Kanhaiya, with his powerful oratorical skills, could be the answer if an arr\\xadangement can be worked out between the two parties.But while there are enough reasons for a closer working relationship, there is already a spanner in the works. A top Congress leader admitted that the AAP government’s recent sanction for the prosecution of Kanhaiya and nine others in a sedition case may force a rethink by the central leadership.The maximum punishment for sedition is life imprisonment, the minimum three years. If convicted, a person cannot contest elections for six years. Kanhaiya has welcomed the prosecution decision, saying he wants a speedy trial so that the country gets to know how a law like sedition is being misused. Not many expect a verdict in the case before the Bihar assembly election but its shadow could still be too overbearing for the grand old party.A section of Congress leaders believes it may be better to ally with the Left than the undependable Jitan Ram Manjhi (Hindustani Awam Morcha) and Mukesh Sahani (Vikassheel Insaan Party). There are, however, sceptics who feel Kanhaiya does not bring much to the table apart from the support of the Muslims, who are already with the opposition.The communication deficit between RJD acting chief Tejashwi Yadav and Kanhaiya could also make it difficult to bring the two together. While Tejashwi is unlikely to cede his leadership status to anyone, Kanhaiya is also a big campaign name, says a senior Congress leader. There is also some reluctance to accept Tejashwi’s leadership in some sections of the party. We are trying to work out a middle path. Tejashwi will be told that Kanhaiya is only interested in nat\\xadional politics. But to get him on our side, the RJD scion will need to agree on whom to project as the face of the grand alliance.A senior Congress leader concedes that the dice are loaded against the opposition with the NDA’s campaign spearhead, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar of the JD(U), seemingly still enjoying the TINA (there is no alternative) factor. Nitish has the image of a performing chief minister, someone who has delivered on multiple fronts, including better roads and electricity for all. That said, the ideological faultlines between the JD(U) and BJP are also clearly visible. We can exploit the situation, but only by putting up a united front, he says. That is easier said than done.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?    Awesome!

On March 1, Union home minister Amit Shah sounded the clarion call at a big rally in central Kolkata, saying a sonar Bangla (golden Bengal) awaited the state if the Bharatiya Janata Party was elected to power in 2021. A day later, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee rolled out a massive public outreach programme, Banglar Gorbo Mamata’, while denouncing the communal violence in Delhi as a planned gen\\xadocide’ and saying the BJP was applying the Gujarat model across the country. The goli maro’ slogans heard at the rally in an eerie reprise of the incendiary slogan\\xadeering by BJP leaders in Delhi and the anti-Shah pro\\xad\\xadtests across the city by the Left and the Congress left no doubt that communal faultlines in the state were deepening.Bengal, of course, is crucial to the BJP’s larger game plan. The party has already made significant inroads in the state, winning 18 of 42 seats and 40 per cent of the vote share in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. It’s already nipping at the heels of Mamata’s TMC (Trinamool Congress) which had only four more seats in LS 2019 and the party fancies its chances of staging an upset victory in 2021.The Union home minister was in Bengal in the company of BJP national president J.P. Nadda (who app\\xadarently left his son’s wedding reception in Himachal midway to be there for the occ\\xadasion) and general secretary (organisation) B.L. Santhosh. Shah began his day in the city with a rally near Shahid Minar, an iconic monument and protest site in the city’s Esplanade area. The irony of his defence of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, even while Delhi was still on tenterhooks in the aftermath of the communal clashes over the same law, was not lost on the politically savvy city. But amid talk of the Ram temple in Ayodhya and the repeal of Article 370 in Kashmir, Shah reiterated his now-familiar refrain that Indian Muslims had nothing to fear from the new law and that the ruling TMC was only trying to fan the fear for political advantage. Shah’s reassurances were by way of damage control, but whether or not people believed him is another matter, says Prasanto Ray, professor emeritus at Presidency University.After the rally at Shahid Minar, Shah went to offer prayers at the Kalighat temple before heading to a city hotel where he met a host of leaders from the state among them, MPs and MLAs, the presidents of the 38 organisational districts, observers and general secretaries. At the over four-hour-long meeting, Shah mainly listened. The final meeting ended around midnight, after which Shah flew back to Delhi.In his meetings, Shah reassured the state functionaries of central support. In the next 390 days, till the assembly election in 2021, he said he would visit the state thrice a month for the next few months, going up to a week in the months leading to the election. Forty-two days in the last six months means Shah will cover each of the 42 Lok Sabha seats besides having a strong team to fan out in every assembly constituency, says a BJP district leader, requesting anonymity. To show how serious he is about the campaign, Shah is also seeking a place to stay in Kolkata. He is also learning Bengali, and is now peppering his speeches with Bengali words. His visit to the Kali temple, too, was of a piece with the plan to woo Bengali Hindu voters and dispel the notion that the BJP is a party of the Hindi heartland, trying to foist itself on the state.Shah’s visit was also meant to remove any suspicions in the minds of the local functionaries of a covert BJP deal with the TMC, which may have arisen following Mamata’s meetings, first with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and then with Shah at a lunch organised by Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik at his residence. He told us BJP workers should not believe rumours of an understanding, just because there had been meetings with the PM and himself, said a leader who was part of Shah’s closed-door meeting with party functionaries.Not to be outdone, Mamata went into a huddle with her partymen the day after Shah’s visit, to sharpen campaign strategies. So the TMC’s Banglar Gorbo Mamata’ (Bengal’s pride, Mamata) is said to be in response to the BJP’s Aar Noi Annyay (No More Injustice), a grievance cell’ to report corruption in the TMC regime. Somewhat on the lines of the BJP’s door-to-door campaign through vistaraks and shakha pracharaks, Mamata too has lined up a series of be humble and simple’ programmes to win back disenchanted voters. Likewise, the TMC’s Didi ke Bolo (Tell Didi), Jalojoge Jogajog (Connect over Snacks) and CAA, CAA/ Chhi, Chhi (Shame on CAA) pitches have provoked counter-campaigns in the form of Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh’s Dada ke Bolo (Tell Dada), Chai Pe Charcha (Conversations over Tea) and Abhinandan yatras.The copycat strategies, says Ray, show the BJP is running out of ideas. Didi ke Bolo is a populist initiative to plug loopholes in governance, whereas BJP’s Aar Noi Annyay has a moral overtone. If morality mattered in politics, Saradha and Narada would have had an impact. So, I doubt if the moral platitudes will serve any end, he says.The TMC is also way ahead in terms of having a credible mass leader. The BJP, on the other hand, does not even have a consensus candidate, perhaps another reason why Shah is keen on frequenting the state to figure out which way the local leadership is leaning. The TMC is also not above using the police and administrative machinery to its advantage. For now, Shah’s main strategy is blanket coverage criss-crossing Bengal, weekly rallies, dinners with Dalit karyakartas in their mud huts and visiting the families of political martyrs. Whether it will help him win Bengal, 2021 will tell.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

The team scored an ordinary total of 132 in the 1st match against the defending champions Australia but what happened there after became a trend. India bundled out the favorites for just 115 runs and won the match by 17-run. A tremor was felt across all the team, courtesy this really gutsy performance by the Indians.The next matches saw India repeating the performance as India won all their matches without scoring a single 150-plus score in the tournament. If the batting order has collapsed after the departure of 16-year-old power house Shafali Verma then the bowlers have done the job to assure the team a victory.That sound off Shafali Verma's batWatch the new No.1 T20I batter do her thing at the nets before India's big #T20WorldCup semi-final.#INDvENG pic.twitter.com/rsugzYKFfjT20 World Cup (@T20WorldCup) March 4, 2020\\nAs Team India look to create history, let us have a look at the stars in the most successful Women's T20 World Cup editions for India.Women's T20 World Cup 2020, AustraliaYoung India batter Shafali Verma has come all guns blazing through out the series.

She has scored 29(15), 39(17), 46(34) and 47(34) en route her 161 in this T20 World Cup edition till now. She is third-placed batter to have scored most runs, only behind England's Natalie Sciver(202) Heather Knight (193) in this edition. Notably, Sciver and Knight would be deprived of further scoring opportunities as England are out of title race now.In bowling department, Poonam Yadav has scalped 9 wickets. The Agra-born single-handedly won the match against Australia and that spell of 4 for 19 would be remembered for long. In the other matches too she has delivered every now and then to give India an edge over oppositions. Pacer Shikha Pandey has scalped 7 wickets for India and given India a good option in the opening spells. The nation would be expecting these three gems, along with others to fire together in the finals on Sunday.Women's T20 World Cup 2018, West IndiesHarmanpreet Kaur and Smriti Mandhana starred with bat for India in 2018.

India won all their matches but failed to overcome the England barrier in the semi-finals. Harmanpreet and Mandhana were the 2nd and 3rd highest run scorers, respectively in the 2018 edition.Mithali Raj scored 107 runs at an average of 53.50. While Mithali's runs may look less in comparison to Kaur and Mandhana's but each of her knocks were valuable at the top of the orders.Radha Yadav, with 8 wickets was the highest wicket-taker for India in that campaign.

The government also kept the promise of farm loan waiver made by Rahul Gandhi during state election last year.advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Amitabh Srivastava    New DelhiMarch 4, 2020UPDATED: March 4, 2020 17:15 IST  Jharkhand finance minister Rameshwar Oraon presenting a copy of state budget to Chief Minister Hemant Soren in Ranchi. (Photo: Twitter/Dipika Pandey Singh)Arvind Kejriwal\\'s Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) may not be a force in Jharakhand, but his politics has impact on Hemant Soren government\\'s first budget. Rahul Gandhi\\'s Congress may be a junior partner in the coalition government in Jharkhand, but Hemant Soren kept the promise that the Congress leader made during the state election campaign last year.In its maiden budget, Hemant Soren government proposed to offer free electricity up to 100 units for households consuming up to 300 units of power per month. This is on the line Kejriwal government\\'s electricity policy of zero bill up to 200 units of consumption.The Hemant Soren government proposed to set up \"Mohalla Clinics\" - another pet project of Kejriwal -- and offer \"digital education\" in government schools as it underscored the need to reform school education in Jharkhand. Another Kejriwal imprint appears in universal health insurance scheme for the residents of Jharkhand.However, the biggest election promise that Hemant Soren government fulfilled with the first budget is the one made by Rahul Gandhi. It announced Rs 2,000 crore farm loan waiver scheme in his budget with the promise of waiving off loans up to Rs 50,000 per farmer.The loan waiver for farmers has been a favourite scheme of Rahul Gandhi, whose party Congress is a member of three-party rulling alliance, which unseated BJP in the assembly polls held in October 2019.Hemant Soren\\'s finance minister Rameshwar Oraon, who presented the budget, is also from Congress. Oraon tabled an estimated budget of Rs 86,370 crore for the year 2020-21. It included sops ranging from universal health insurance to farmer loan waivers, from stipends for the jobless to dhoti, sari and lungi to 57 lakh poor families twice a year at a cost of Rs 10 each. Now, ration cards are to be given to 10 lakh people aged above 50.Though the BJP-led opposition boycotted the assembly proceedings to protest against the Speaker\\'s decision of not recognizing reinducted BJP leader Babulal Marandi as leader of the Opposition, the treasury benches remained upbeat with what Hemant Soren described as \"pro-poor and inclusive\" budget.Hemant Soren said the budget aims at achieving 7.2 per cent growth rate for state GDP (Gross Domestic Product) from current 5.7 per cent, and push per capital income to Rs 65,802 from the existing Rs 62,345.The Hemant Soren government\\'s budget proposed a universal health insurance capped at Rs 5 lakh. However, the employees of state and central governments will not be covered under this scheme.The budget further proposed to provide free treatment of cancer, kidney and serious liver diseases by noted doctors to individuals in families with an annual income up to Rs 8 lakh.The budget expanded the scholarship window by offering what was so far available to ST/SC/ OBC students from Classes I to XII to students of all categories and classes. The budget also offered an additional Rs 50,000 to each beneficiary for homes under the PM Awas Yojana.The jobless graduate registered with the employment exchanges of the state will be given Rs 5,000 per year for two years. The relief sum will go up to Rs 7,000 for unemployed postgraduates.Of the Rs 73,315.94 crore that comes under revenue expenditure and Rs 13,054.06 crore under capital expenditure, the Hemant Soren government has set aside Rs 37,445.06 crore as establishment cost, Rs 34,485.72 crore for implementation of state schemes, Rs 3,315.27 crore for central schemes and Rs 11,123.95 crore for expenditure on Centre-sponsored schemes.When it comes to revenue, Rs 15,839 crore comes from grants-in-aid, Rs 11,820.34 earmarked from non-tax revenue, Rs 21,669.50 crore from the state\\'s taxes and Rs 25,979.91 crore from the state\\'s share in central taxes.Calling the budget as Hemant Soren asserted that his government looks to ensure that \"no one dies due to lack of food, water and healthcare, and children instead of graz- ing goats go to school. It is a revolutionary budget.\"Read | Jharkhand Assembly adjourned twice over BJP\\'s Leader of Opposition demandAlso read | Jharkhand: Three get death for rape in less than a month of crimeYou may like it | Another son rises in east: Hemant Soren is next Jharkhand CMFor sports news, updates, live scores and cricket fixtures, log on to indiatoday.in/sports.

       " \" Jump to navigation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n Sidhu is back in demandAfter winning Delhi, AAP is now courting the charismatic motormouth to revive its Punjab unitadvertisement\\n\\n\\n  Anilesh Mahajan  February 28, 2020 ISSUE DATE: March 9, 2020UPDATED: February 28, 2020 15:01 IST  What’s on his mind? Photo: Sanjeev Kumar/ Getty ImagesThe Aam Aadmi Party’s spectacular victory in the Delhi assembly election has infused new life into its fractured party organisation in Punjab. Not only is it now looking to win back rebels but also wooing cricketer-turned-Congress politician Navjot Singh Sidhu.With assembly elections in Punjab just two years away, the challenge for AAP is to reinvigorate the faction-ridden state unit and overcome the trust deficit with the people. Sidhu, state AAP leaders feel, can not only be the rallying force but also rope in smaller political entities, such as Simarjit Singh Bains’s Lok Insaaf Party.Sidhu, though, is keeping his cards close to his chest, and did not respond to messages and calls from INDIA TODAY. The Congress MLA from Amritsar East resigned from the Punjab cabinet last July amid heightened tensions with Chief Minister Amarinder Singh. He has been keeping a low profile ever since. In November 2019, Sidhu attended the inauguration of the Kartarpur Corridor, but not as part of the Punjab government delegation. He did not campaign for the Congress in the Delhi election either.AAP leaders in Punjab claim Prashant Kishor, who strategised their party’s Delhi campaign, had a word with Sidhu. If negotiations do make any headway, a major pain point will be Sidhu’s insistence on being projected as the chief ministerial candidate and being given a free hand to pick candidates. AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal will also have to factor in Sidhu’s penchant for courting controversies. There’s high recall of his controversial trip to Pakistan for prime minister Imran Khan’s swearing-in ceremony in 2018, when he was seen hugging Pakistan army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa, and his unsavoury remarks on India’s air strikes in Balakot in 2019.A key event that could shape the course of the Punjab assembly poll will be the elections to the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) next year. While the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has controlled the SGPC for over three decades, the party lost a section of the panthic vote for its unconvincing stand on incidents of desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib in 2015.AAP has attracted several Sikh politicians with an SGPC background in the past six years. Rebel Akali factions, including SAD (Taksali), are eyeing an alliance with these leaders for the SGPC poll. A defeat for the SAD in the SGPC will indirectly benefit AAP. Sidhu has clear feelers from SAD (Taksali). Sidhu is welcome to join us, but his being incommunicado does not help, says Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, the Rajya Sabha MP who has joined forces with the outfit.This is not AAP’s first attempt to woo Sidhu. After quitting the BJP in 2016, Sidhu had held inconclusive parleys with Kejriwal. On Kishor’s suggestion, he met Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka and joined the Congress ahead of the 2017 Punjab election.Outside Delhi, AAP has presence only in the Punjab assembly. The party’s lone Lok Sabha MP, Bhagwant Singh Mann, represents Sangrur in the state. In the previous assembly poll, AAP captured 20 seats and a 23.8 per cent vote share. Subsequently, MLAs Sukhpal Singh Khaira and Baldev Singh quit to launch the Punjab Ekta Dal while Amarjit Singh Sandhoa and Nazar Singh Manshahia joined the Congress. Advocate-turned-politician H.S. Phoolka resigned from his seat and MLA Kanwar Sandhu remains suspended from the party. In the 2019 Lok Sabha election, AAP polled 7.6 per cent votes in Punjab and 12 of its candidates lost their deposits. Should he join, Sidhu could be the booster shot AAP needs in Punjab. But, for now, he is keeping everyone guessing.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Yediyurappa at an event in Belagavi, Jan. 2020A campaign is building up against Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa in the ruling BJP in Karnataka. This follows the denial of ministerial berths to several party old-timers in the February 6 cabinet expansion and the chief minister’s reported bid to secure an influential post for his son B.Y. Vijayendra in the party organisation.For over a week now, two unsigned letters (in English and Kannada) have been circulating in BJP circles, citing Yediyurappa’s age and failing health’ and his attempts to empower his son, and demanding the appointment of a new chief minister. Yediyurappa, who turns 77 on February 27, has drawn the ire of senior BJP leaders, such as Umesh Katti, Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, Murugesh Nirani, M.P. Renukacharya, Siddu Savadi, Sanganna Karadi and Anand Mamani, as they were left out of the cabinet. Katti and Nirani met BJP president J.P. Nadda in the first week of February to lodge a complaint.The rebellion’ against Yediyurappa has been launched by Lingayat leaders in the state BJP. The Lingayats, the sect to which Yediyurappa also belongs, make up about 17 per cent of Karnataka’s population and have been BJP loyalists. The infighting began when BSY, beholden to the 10 MLAs who had defected from the Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) last year and helped the BJP come to power in Karnataka, was forced to accommodate them in government.There is also disgruntlement over efforts to prop up Vijayendra, with a senior BJP leader saying that dynastic rule will not be tolerated in the partyWith age catching up, Yediyurappa wants to cement positions for his sons in the BJP, says N. Prakash, a Mysuru-based political analyst. The induction of the 10 disqualified MLAs had already enraged party veterans. Yediyurappa’s supporters are ganging up on him.The appointment of the 10 MLAs itself was marked with drama, and Yediyurappa had to change the portfolios of six of them within a day. Katti has gone public with his attack on Yediyurappa. I have been a minister for 13 years. With God’s grace, my aim now is to occupy the chief minister’s post, he said.The miffed ministerial aspirants have lately been joined by more rebels’ Mohan Limbikayi, S. Munenkoppa, C.M. Nimbannavar, Aravind Bellad, Mahesh Kumtahalli and Shashikant Akkappa Naik. We will intensify our fight in March after the chief minister’s birthday celebrations, said one of them.While Yediyurappa’s followers have dismissed the letters as mischief by a few irate legislators, Prakash cautions: The issue will affect the image of the government, which has hardly anything to show in terms of performance. Yediyurappa should also downplay his son’s role in the BJP.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

The Ashok Gehlot government is looking at it as a means to tide over the massive shortfall in the state’s share in central taxes (estimated to go down by Rs 10,072 crore to Rs 36,039 crore), but along with the 20 per cent hike in liquor prices last year, the hospitality industry says the new policy will lead to another washout tourist season.On another level, the new excise policy also comes with target.(Rs 12,500 crore for 2020-21, up Rs 1,500 crore year on year) and penalties (for failing quarterly sales targ\\xadets). Liquor vend owners gave a call for a boycott of the open e-auction, forcing the government to issue advertisements on February 24 to encourage bidding. Industry insiders say with liquor in Rajasthan now 40 per cent costlier than, say, neighbouring Haryana, bootlegging and inter-state smuggling are set to rise, whereas sellers will stop issuing bills, which will, in turn, hit VAT collections, and hotels selling liquor without licence will mushroom.Other peeves of the tourism industry include the lack of permits to sell draught beer and the 30-plus clearances to sell hard liquor at restaurants. Rajasthan, which shares borders with Punjab, Haryana, UP, MP and Gujarat, has also seen a spurt in liquor smuggling in the past decade. In some areas, bootleggers now deliver liquor at home at half the rate charged at the vends.Excise officials say they have made preparations to ensure that only bottles bearing barcodes are sold though PoS machines. This, they say, will make it tough for sellers to evade taxes or indulge in selling smuggled liquor. But stakeholders feel the new excise policy unfairly targets legal licence holders and insist that had the government engaged with them, they could have offered alternative suggestions to mobilise more revenues.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Menon     Chennai February 28, 2020 ISSUE DATE: March 9, 2020UPDATED: February 28, 2020 14:59 IST  ALL for amma Chief minister Palaniswami (right) with his deputy Panneerselvam: Photo-Jason GAhead of the assembly election due in May next year, the ruling All India Anna Dra\\xadv\\xad\\xadida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) is doling out fistfuls of state largesse in the name of its late lamented leader J. Jayalalithaa. February 24 marked her 72nd birth anniversary, and it will henceforth be observed as Girl Child Protection Day in Tamil Nadu.To mark the occasion, Chief Min\\xad\\xad\\xadi\\xad\\xadster Edappadi K. Palaniswami announced five schemes for girls living in state-run homes. When orphaned/ abandoned girls turn 22, the government will deposit Rs 2 lakh in their bank accounts. For girls who face problems after leaving the homes, on turning 19, a special grant will be given to ensure their social and financial safety. It will include assistance for higher education, skill development, job opportunities and self-employment. The assistance will continue till they are 50, says Palaniswami, who also raised the monthly grant to foster par\\xadents of ado\\xadpted children from Rs 2,000 for three years to Rs 4,000 for five years.Noting that the Ammathottil’ (cradle baby) scheme, introduced by Jayalalithaa, had greatly reduced cases of female infanticide, he pointed to how the female sex ratio at birth had increased from 918 in 2014-15 to 936 in 2019. District administrations that make efforts to better it will get medals from now on, says Palaniswami. In the fifth scheme, wards of state-run homes who fulfil the employment eligibility criteria will be given preference in select categories of government jobs.Earlier, in January, the state rena\\xadmed two universities after Amma, Tamil Nadu Dr J. Jayalalithaa Fisheries University and Tamil Nadu Dr J. Jayalalithaa Music and Fine Arts University. The idea of freely invoking the late chief minister’s name is obviously to cash in on her goodwill and to try and ensure the rank and file continue to rally behind Palaniswami and deputy chief minister O. Panneerselvam.Presenting its last full-fledged budget ahead of the polls, the AIADMK government made generous allocations to its flagship welfare schemes, including Rs 6,500 crore for food subsidy, and announced interest waivers for prompt repayment of crop loans.Seeking to give fresh impetus to the low-cost Amma unavagams (canteens), it announced that mobile units would be launched to take food to construction work sites.Panneerselvam, who holds the finance portfolio, while allocating Rs 4,315 crore to the social security pension scheme, announced an addition of 173,000 new beneficiaries. The government also announced enhanced comp\\xadensation under the Amma accident-cum-life insurance scheme for BPL families, Rs 2 lakh in case of natural death of a breadwinner or a permanent disability caused by an accident and Rs 4 lakh in the case of accident deaths. Palaniswami also launched the Amma Youth Sports Scheme on January 13, providing Rs 121.2 crore to provide playground facilities and sports equipment to village and town panchayats to enthuse the rural youth. With all the Amma schemes for disadvantaged groups, the AIADMK will be hoping it has done enough to protect its vote bank next year.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Given their current numbers in the Vidhan Sabha, both the ruling Congress and the BJP will win one seat each. The third seat is likely to see a contest. The Congress has a better chance of bagging it, but the BJP under Amit Shah has made it a norm to not give up in close contests.Currently, of the 11 RS seats from the state, the BJP has eight and the Congress three. Each candidate needs 58 votes to win a seat. At present, the Congress has 114 MLAs, the BJP 107, the SP one, the BSP two while four seats are with Independents. For the third seat, the Congress needs two more votes, which it expects will come from the ranks of the Independents, BSP and SP legislators that support the Kamal Nath government. The BJP needs nine more votes than the 107 it has to win the third seat. Party sources say a second candidate will be fielded, in the hope that infighting in the Congress will lead to cross-voting in its favour.The names of Congr\\xadess probables include Digvij\\xadaya Singh (renominated), Jyotiraditya Scindia and a few other biggies. There is even a demand to give general secretary Priyanka Gandhi a nomina\\xadt\\xadion from MP. In all likelihood, though, Scindia will be the second candidate to ensure that his flock of upset MLAs they have been demanding the PCC chief’s post for him stay with the party.As for the BJP candi\\xadd\\xadates, the sure seat is likely to go to general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya or ex-minister J.S. Pawaiya. For the third seat, state BJP spokesperson Rahul Kothari says they are confident of securing adequate numbers given that other parties and Independents may decide to support our candidates, suggesting that this April, cross-voting is a real possibility.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

PK insisted he was not there to form alliances or stitch election strategies, but just two days later, he was spotted in a Delhi hotel, meeting with three leaders of the state’s erstwhile grand alliance’, former Union minister Upendra Kushwaha of the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP), ex-chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi of the Hindustani Awam Morcha-Secular (HAM-S) and Mukesh Sahni of the Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP).Although the three leaders have not said so on record, and PK maintained his development narrative even after the Delhi meeting, word is that the confabulations were about alliance strategies for the upcoming Bihar election. The three parties are still unproven electorally, but they have some claim to vote banks Kushwaha has influence among the Kushwahas or Koeris, a dominant OBC community that makes up 8 per cent of the population in Bihar; Manjhi feels the 4 per cent Musahar vote is his own; and Sahni counts on the support of the EBC Mallah boatmen.But why were the three meeting without a repr\\xadesentative of the biggest opposition player, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) around? The idea, political observers say, is to pressure the RJD to fall in line. A Nitish Kumar-led NDA will find it much easier if someone from the RJD first family [read: Tejashwi Yadav] were projected as the CM candidate, said a leader present at the Delhi meeting, on condition of anonymity. Note the JD(U) pitch: our 15 years versus the RJD’s 15 years’. Nitish wins that perception battle hands down.The idea, then, is to deny the NDA that easy target. The RJD is the NDA’s favourite punching bag; we want to change that narrative. If it works, the NDA won’t find it so easy to take us on, he says.The argument has some merit. The RJD with its traditional M-Y voter base of Muslims (16.5 per cent) and Yadavs (14 per cent) is no doubt formidable, but in a rainbow coalition, it is also a vulnerability, as other potential support groupssuch as the Kushwahas, Dalits and Mallahs baulk at the prospect of going with a formation where the M-Y bloc is dominant. The M-Y vote bank can be decisive in a triangular or four-cornered contest, but in a bipolar contest, it is just not enough to swing the election.Even before meeting Kishor in Delhi, the three opposition leaders were unconvinced about Tejashwi’s leadership. Lalu Prasad Yadav’s chosen heir seems to have made up his mind against letting the three parties have a larger share than he thinks is legitimate. The RJD will fight at least 150 of the 243 assembly seats in Bihar, says a senior RJD leader. The Congress will get a larger share of the remaining seats. The other allies will get what is left. They can take it or leave it.The aggressive posturing by the three leaders has triggered much speculation in Bihar’s political circles. Is there space for a new opposition in the state? Bihar has often been described as a state of three principal partiesthe JD(U), BJP and RJD. The Congress and Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) are fourth and fifth in this pecking order, and perform well only when they back the winning horse. By themselves, the three first movers lack the necessary ballast, but they might count on PK, the ace election strategist, to help stitch a new-look winning combination. The 2019 Lok Sabha poll numbers suggest the three parties, along with Congress, can make a dent. The Congress bagged 7.8 per cent of the vote, RLSP (3.7 per cent), HAM-S (2.4 per cent) and VIP 1.7 per cent. Their combined 15.6 per cent vote plus the RJD’s 15.7 per cent add up to a sizeable vote share. But a reconstituted opposition is far from a done deal, and as Bihar Congress president M.M. Jha told INDIA TODAY on June 24, the actual seat distribution would involve many practicalities.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Menon     Chennai February 21, 2020 ISSUE DATE: March 2, 2020UPDATED: February 21, 2020 13:36 IST  No drilling: Villagers at Neduvasal, Pudukottai, protesting hydrocarbon exploration in the Cauvery delta. (Photo: Jaison G)On February 10, Tamil Nadu chief minister E.K. Palaniswami announced that the Cauvery delta would be declared a Protected Special Agricultural Zone (PSAZ) to accord primacy to the state\\'s food security and to protect farmers\\' livelihoods. Over the past four decades, the delta\\'s share of the state\\'s food production has fallen from 65 per cent to 40 per cent. A major cause of this decline is hydrocarbon exploration. In recent years, there have been many protests against such projects, which not only occupy fertile agricultural lands but also cause ecological damage.The chief minister\\'s announcement followed his objection, in January, to a unilateral amendment by the Union government to the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification, 2006. This amendment relaxed the environmental clearance requirements for oil and gas exploration. \"The state government will not permit hydrocarbon exploration in the delta region, which would affect the livelihood of farmers,\" announced the chief minister. He has also reportedly written to the Centre for support in creating the PSAZ, which will include parts of Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam, Pudukottai, Cuddalore, Ariyalur, Karur and Tiruchirapalli. These areas make up the state\\'s rice bowl and produce about 3.3 million tonnes of grain every year.Farmers have long opposed hydrocarbon projects in the delta, pointing to the damage they cause, such as groundwater contamination. Agriculture scientist M.S. Swaminathan has also endorsed the chief minister\\'s plan: \"Areas identified for PSAZ status should be given facilities to ensure that agriculture remains economically viable. This is an important step to ensure the future of our food and ecological security.\"The chief minister\\'s plan is to allow only agriculture and allied industries in the region. \"Enacting specific legislation to protect the region, though welcome, is inadequate,\" says Professor S. Janakarajan, president of the South Asia Consortium for Interdisciplinary Water Resources Studies. \"There are grey areas. The state cannot act unilaterally, ignoring central government laws that permit entities like ONGC to take up [hydrocarbon] exploration. Another serious concern is the fracking technology these entities rely on. It has already been banned in several countries for the ecological harm it causes. Issues like these have to be addressed for any meaningful protection of the delta.\"The state has, in the past, taken note of, and acted on, farmers\\' protests. In 2013, Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa had ordered the suspension of coal-bed methane exploration and production in Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts, following it up with a ban in 2015. However, in 2017, the Centre signed contracts for hydrocarbon extraction in 31 locations in the state. With an eye on investments over Rs 90,000 crore, the state government also notified 45 villages in the Cuddalore and Nagapattinam districts in the delta as part of a Petroleum, Chemical and Petrochemical Investment Region that year. (Chief Minister Palaniswami\\'s proposed PSAZ puts a question mark on this ambitious scheme.) Then, in 2019, the central government also allowed Vedanta Ltd to conduct impact assessment studies to drill 274 offshore and onshore hydrocarbon wells in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.Facts like these will make it difficult for the chief minister to walk the talk. He has to get the ministry of petroleum and natural resources on the same page and get the Union government to agree to the proposed PSAZ. This will be all the more difficult since the Centre\\'s move to relax the rules for hydrocarbon firms is aimed at incentivising increased production in India to address the country\\'s high oil-import dependence. The Tamil Nadu government will face both pressure from the Union government and litigation from firms that have already invested significant sums in such projects, which could lead to adverse consequences for investment in the state.At the same time, the chief minister is also using this issue to score points off the rival DMK. The PSAZ tag was a central poll plank of all political parties in the state, both in the previous assembly election and in last year\\'s Lok Sabha election. By winning 29 of the 45 assembly seats in the delta region in the 2016 assembly election, the AIADMK had conquered what was seen as a DMK stronghold. However, by winning all but one of the 40 Lok Sabha seats in the state and Puducherry last summer, the DMK-led alliance showed that it had regained the upper hand. Moreover, the party managed to win over half the votes in the Cauvery delta, particularly in Thanjavur and Nagapattinam, in local body elections in December 2019.Some analysts wonder, therefore, if the chief minister\\'s announcement was made primarily with an eye on the 2021 assembly poll.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Tare  Mumbai February 21, 2020 ISSUE DATE: March 2, 2020UPDATED: February 21, 2020 13:34 IST  Ground work: Uddhav Thackeray with farmers in Sangli. (Photo: Raju Sanadi)Maharashtra officials are busy setting in motion Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray\\'s ambitious scheme to waive farmers\\' loans upto Rs 2 lakh. The government has begun a pilot run of the scheme before its official launch on February 21, even as Thackeray, speaking in Jalgaon on February 16, reiterated that he was committed to alleviating farmers\\' distress since he had come to power with their blessings. The chief minister has also instructed officials to be \\'sensitive\\'. \"Do not think you are doing farmers a favour by waiving their loans,\" he told them recently.The state government says the loan waiver will benefit 3.64 million farmers. Prodded by Thackeray, the cooperative department has developed a portal for the scheme, on which data of about 3.22 million farmers has already been uploaded. Eligible farmers will have to authenticate themselves with Aadhaar IDs-for which 96,000 centres have been set up-and biometrics. Government data shows almost 95 per cent of the beneficiaries have Aadhaar-linked bank accounts. Thackeray praised officials for completing the ground work in a span of 15 days. \"This is the country\\'s biggest loan-waiver scheme; I want you to be sensible in its implementation,\" he said.At Rs 40,000 crore, the one-time loan waiver will be one of the country\\'s most expensive. To fund it, the Maharashtra government may have to curtail allocations to some other departments by 20-30 per cent. Given the state\\'s total debt of Rs 4.72 lakh crore (2019-20), about 17 per cent of its GDP, some experts have panned the scheme as an ill-conceived misadventure.The loan waiver will benefit some 3.64 million farmers. Thackeray says it\\'s the country\\'s biggest such schemeA cooperative department official says Thackeray wants a smooth rollout of the scheme, as a similar initiative by the erstwhile BJP-Shiv Sena government had suffered from technical glitches. \"We have taken utmost care so that the new scheme is implemented in a foolproof manner,\" says the official.Keen to dispel the notion in some quarters that he is an \\'urban politician\\' who knows little about agrarian issues, Thackeray kept the agriculture portfolio with his party and gave charge of the ministry to Dadaji Bhuse, a farmer. The ministry has set up farmer assistance centres in each of the state\\'s 350 talukas and launched a portal that allows farmers a single-window application for all agri schemes. \"Farmers no longer need to file the same application year after year,\" says Bhuse.Beginning February 16, Bhuse has been visiting farmers to get a first-hand assessment of their problems. In Bhuse\\'s assembly constituency of Malegaon Outer, farmer Shantaram Gawali complained to him about problems in getting crop loans and seeds.The exercise is expected to throw up a litany of problems. Farmers have been complaining about not receiving the minimum support price (MSP) for their produce. Suhas Bhatkar, a farmer from Amravati, says he sold cotton at Rs 5,200 per quintal whereas the MSP is Rs 5,500. Others have complained that they had to sell tur dal at Rs 4,900 a tonne and chickpea at Rs 4,300 per tonne, as against the MSP of Rs 5,800 and Rs 4,800, respectively.Agriculture expert Vijay Jawandhiya says the Thackeray government has failed to take steps to augment farm incomes. He says he wrote to Thackeray for an additional assistance of Rs 10,000 per acre for farmers, but has \"not received any response yet\".Rs 40,000 crore is what the one-time loan waiver scheme will cost the state exchequerWhile the BJP\\'s Vinod Tawde says Thackeray \"lacks innovative ideas\", Jawandhiya says loan waivers cannot be a long-term solution. \"Sharad Pawar had demanded that orange farmers be compensated for losses due to unseasonal rains,\" he adds. \"I want to know from the government what happened to that demand.\"Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Menon     Hyderabad February 21, 2020 ISSUE DATE: March 2, 2020UPDATED: February 21, 2020 13:28 IST  Appetite for reform: K. Chandrashekar Rao addresses district collectors in Hyderabad, Aug. 2019. (File photo)Telangana chief minister K. Chandrashekar Rao is reforming the state\\'s revenue administration, ushering in a new unified revenue law. As a first step, he has restructured the district administration: instead of being assisted by a single deputy collector, district collectors will now be supported by two additional collectors, one of whom will attend exclusively to local bodies while the other will be tasked with making panchayats more efficient.On February 11, the chief minister explained his plans at a specially convened district collectors\\' conference. \"Implementing government policies for welfare and development should be a priority,\" he said. In aid of this, authorities will be allowed to take measures for development to make their districts self-sufficient. This includes monetising local assets to increase revenue. \"The administration can be streamlined by strengthening the institution of collectors,\" added the chief minister. \"Collectors have been given more powers.\" One such is the authority to rectify land records. Treating land as a key source of income, under the proposed new revenue law, every bit of land will be accounted for, with officials ensuring that ownership disputes are resolved and clear land titles issued. Revenue tribunals are proposed in every district to dispose of disputes and simplify land ownership.Telangana spends nearly half its revenue on welfare and developmentImproving the state\\'s finances is a big concern, since Telangana spends almost 50 per cent of its revenue-about Rs 40,000 crore-on welfare and development initiatives. The chief minister is unwilling to curtail any of these schemes, even as a belt-tightening measure. \"Telangana is facing a [financial] shortfall due to the huge cut in central taxes as well as the Centre avoiding paying GST dues,\" says B. Vinod Kumar, vice chairman of the state planning and development board. \"The Centre has also decided not to approve the 15th Finance Commission\\'s recommendation to give [Telangana] a special grant of Rs 723 crore for 2020-21.\"Over the next five years, Telangana requires Rs 40,170 crore for its lift irrigation projects and Rs 12,770 crore for Mission Bhagiratha, its piped domestic water supply scheme. To keep these and other schemes going, the state may have to raise taxes to at least partly make up for the shortfall in funding. For the moment, the chief minister is banking on increased government efficiency to deliver savings.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

(Photo: Somnath Sen)Everyone, irrespective of caste and community, is entitled to quality education. The family\\'s financial constraints cannot be allowed to become an impediment. Deputy commissioner, Gumla, take cognisance of the report, do the needful and update.\"This was Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren\\'s tweet on February 14, with which he tagged a newspaper report on how Amisha, a state-level school topper, was struggling to pursue her education because of financial hardships. The post had an electrifying effect. Within three days, Gumla deputy commissioner Shashi Ranjan met Amisha\\'s parents and assured them of help. \"We are making all arrangements so that Amisha, who is studying in Ranchi, faces no hindrance in her studies,\" Ranjan told India Today.From ordering an air ambulance for a girl facing renal failure to reuniting a homeless woman with her son, from providing relief to a dead army jawan\\'s wife to ordering a probe into how tribal land was transferred to a hospital, Soren has turned Twitter into a governance tool. Since assuming charge on December 29, he has sent more than 250 tweets related to governance matters, keeping officials on their toes. Now, the chief minister\\'s Twitter handle is regularly tagged by people airing their grievances on social media. Once Soren takes up these complaints, his office pursues them. Sources in the chief minister\\'s office (CMO) say Soren\\'s Twitter handle is managed by the same team that ran his social media campaign during the assembly election.The headstrong Soren of his first stint as Jharkhand chief minister (July 2013 to December 2014)-when he fired three ministers from his cabinet despite his government\\'s wafer-thin majority-appears to have reinvented himself. In his second innings, he has really upped the outreach of the CMO.Soren\\'s tweets are advertising his outreach and keeping officials on their toesSoren started his tenure with the magnanimous gesture of dropping an FIR he had filed during the election campaign against his predecessor Raghubar Das. But he vows to remain unsparing of officials who have pending cases against them. Like additional director general of police Anurag Gupta, whose suspension he ordered on February 14; Gupta is accused of misusing his position in the 2016 Rajya Sabha election. While the Election Commission had ordered departmental action against Gupta in June 2017 and an FIR was subsequently registered, the Das government did not pursue the case. \"Soren could have suspended Gupta immediately after taking over but he took more than 45 days to do so. The idea is to not appear to be someone who has scores to settle,\" says a senior IPS officer, on condition of anonymity.Soren has also ordered a scrutiny of projects undertaken by the road construction department, which was headed by Das. Sources say discrepancies have surfaced in the rates fixed for construction work in this and other departments during Das\\'s tenure.However, bureaucrats are apprehensive that the Soren government may go soft on radical tribal activists. Soren\\'s first cabinet meeting, in which it was decided to drop sedition cases against Pathalgadi movement leaders, kindled these fears. However, he has sought to ally those fears by visiting, this January, the homes of seven villagers killed in an alleged strike by pro-Pathalgadi elements in West Singhbhum district and issuing a warning that such incidents would not be tolerated.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Menon     Bidar February 21, 2020 ISSUE DATE: March 2, 2020UPDATED: February 21, 2020 13:19 IST  Going by the book? A class in session at a Shaheen Group school in Bidar. (Photo: K Shiva)There seems to be no end to the Kafkaesque nightmare a small school skit has triggered in Bidar, Karnataka. It was meant to be an in-house performance, but a proud parent, Muhammad Yousuf Raheem, decided to stream it on Facebook. Local BJP activist Nilesh Rakshyal took note, and lodged a police complaint stating that children were being instigated into uttering unpatriotic words, hurling abuses at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and being trained to say that if the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) came into force, Muslims would have to leave the country.The police, of course, wasted no time acting on the complaint. Storming into the school (whose spacious facilities on the five-acre campus they have regularly used for hosting police programmes), a posse of policemen, some in uniform, tried to identify the students who had participated in the play as well as 85 others who watched it. This went on for five days and many children stopped coming to school for fear of being questioned by the police. Never mind that the Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights pulled up the police for violating the norms of the Juvenile Justice Act and asked them to stop questioning the children. \"When the children were being questioned, their parents or guardians should have been present and the police should not have gone in uniform,\" says the commission\\'s chairman, Antony Sebastian, also a juvenile justice advocate.Before long, the police booked Abdul Qadeer, founder-chairman of the Allama Iqbal Educational Society and Shaheen Group of Institutions; Fareeda Begum, 50, headmistress of the Shaheen Urdu Primary School; Najibunnisa, the 46-year-old single mother of the girl who uttered the controversial lines on Modi, and four others, under Sections 504, 505 (2), 124 A, 153A and 34 of the Indian Penal Code. Both Fareeda (whose husband is a part-time mechanic) and Najibunnisa, the breadwinners of their families, were in Bidar Central Prison for a fortnight.Ordering the conditional release of the women on February 14, Bidar principal and district sessions judge Managoli Premavathi observed: \"The drama shows that the children have condemned enforcement laws. No other community has been named; all they have said is Muslims will have to leave the country.\" In its bail order, the court observed that the women had not been named in the original FIR. It was the remand memo that noted that the children had allegedly said they were asked by Fareeda to enact the play. Similarly, the child who \\'spoke derogatory words [referring to] using a chappal against Prime Minister Narendra Modi\\' revealed in her interrogation that her mother (Najibunnisa) had asked her to use the words.School authorities point out that the performance was part of routine classroom activity. Seven students, aged between nine and 12, had been asked to put up a six-minute performance on the NRC on January 21. \"A key element of the National Curriculum Framework stipulates creating awareness on contemporary social issues. This was just another assignment given to students,\" claims Thouseef Madikeri, CEO of the Shaheen Education Foundation. Now, the Karnataka High Court has to decide if the student play was a creative or literary activity within the ambit of freedom of expression. It is likely to decide by February 25 whether or not Qadeer and the four other accused should be arrested and tried on sedition and related charges. \"Every citizen of the country has the right to oppose a law intended to be brought into force and this cannot be treated as sedition,\" says Keshavarao H. Srimale, one of the lawyers who moved the bail application for the two women. \"Further, since there is no reference to any other community, there is no question of causing disharmony among communities.\"Following the initial outcry by politicians, including former chief minister Siddaramaiah, the police are treading cautiously. \"We are awaiting the findings of the forensic analysis of the surveillance camera footage from the school\\'s recordings for a fuller understanding of the course of events to act on the charges against the accused,\" said a senior police officer. Activists in Bidar argue that it is a motivated complaint as the anti-NRC rally on December 23 drew a huge response. \"Several disparate groups got together for a common cause under the banner of a secular forum. This has turned out to be unsettling for the BJP,\" said Mansoor Ahmed Quadri, district president of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen.Proving the charge of sedition (for which the maximum punishment is life imprisonment) is easier said than done. A five-judge constitutional bench of the Supreme Court presided over by Chief Justice Bhuvaneshwar Prasad Sinha in Kedar Nath Singh vs State of Bihar (1962) laid down the guiding principles for dealing with offences under Section 124A of the IPC. The judges ruled that \\'comments, however strongly worded, expressing disapprobation of the actions of the government, without exciting those feelings that generate the inclination to cause public disorder by acts of violence\\', would not be penalised. \"Disloyalty to government established by law is not the same thing as commenting in strong terms upon the measures or acts of government, or its agencies, so as to ameliorate the condition of the people or to secure the cancellation or alteration of those acts or measures by lawful means... without exciting those feelings of enmity and disloyalty which imply excitement to public disorder or use of violence.\\'Besides, the sedition law itself has other limitations. \"It uses words that are amenable to multiple interpretations. It also relies on the perception in the mind of the listener, adding to the potential for misuse,\" says Kunal Ambasta, who teaches at the National Law School of India University, Bengaluru.Mainstreaming the MarginalisedShaheen is the mythical bird that flies farther than a falcon. That is what the educational enterprise that blends modern formal education with religious teachings from the Quran strives to achieve progressively. Soaring higher. It is also the school motto. What Abdul Qadeer started as a single-room facility with 18 students in 1989-while searching for a good school for a younger sibling-is today a full-fledged facility. \"In Bidar alone, there are 9,000 students from 23 states and nine countries with diverse backgrounds,\" says Dr Thouseef Madikeri, CEO, Shaheen Education Foundation. The 43 institutions across nine states are expected to go up to 55 in 13 states by the next academic year. \"Many more who go to the traditional madrassas for religious learning alone, especially in the north, need to be exposed to quality modern education,\" he says. More than a brick in the wall: Shaheen Education Foundation School.Madikeri takes pride in the fact that Shaheen students excel in the entrance exams to professional colleges; last year, 327 of them secured medical college seats through the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test. The educational enterprise is also known for its successful experiments like the Academic Intensive Care Unit, which takes charge of dropouts besides mainstreaming those exposed only to madrassa education. About 500 are admitted to the AICU every year and its alumni are now among those pursuing collegiate education at the Jamia Millia Islamia and the Aligarh Muslim University. This is enabling Hafizes (those who memorise the Quran) get modern education.Although its tuition fee is in line with quality private schools, the Shaheen Group extends concessions and scholarships to deserving indigent students. It also takes in students from socially and economically backward communities while wearing the \\'minority\\' institution tag.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Singh, who took over at the end of January 2019 as the second DGP to serve this government. This has triggered a political storm, with opposition BJP legislators accusing the government of targeting honest officers’. True or not, there is certainly a shake-up taking place on February 10, 52 IPS officers in the state were transferred, many of them within six months to a year of assuming office.There are many theories about why the state government is looking to replace the DGP. One possible flashpoint is the tussle between the IAS and the IPS over an incident on January 19. On that day, at a pro-CAA rally in Rajgarh, allegedly taken out despite prohibitory orders, a law and order situation developed when district collector Nidhi Nivedita and other officials tried to prevent the rally. In the ensuing scuffle, Nivedita allegedly slapped an assistant sub-inspector, which led to him filing a complaint with the Rajgarh superintendent of police. While the political executive and the IAS broadly supported the collector, sources say DGP Singh asked for a report to be filed after an inquiry by a DSP (deputy superintendent of police) level officer. The report, which found the collector guilty, was then forwarded to the home department. This infuriated IAS officers in the state, who have been pushing CM Nath to replace DGP Singh.Sources say Singh’s position has been precarious for some time. Although he was appointed in January 2019, his confirmation has been pending for months. Based on a Supreme Court ruling for the selection of DGPs issued following the Prakash Singh vs Union of India case to reduce political control over such appointments the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is required to send state governments a list of three officers from which they may select a DGP. In November last year, the UPSC had sent the MP government such a list, naming IPS officers V.K. Singh, M.S. Gupta and V.K. Johri. On February 8 this year, the government wrote back, rejecting the list because one of the three, V.K. Johri had not submitted a written consent to be considered for the post. It has asked the UPSC to submit a fresh list.All eyes are now on the UPSC. If it resends the same names, the state government will likely continue with Singh. (Some suggest the government is not actually interested in replacing him, and that this effort is only aimed at reining him in.) Alternatively, the new list could suggest other officers, including special investigation team chief Rajendra Kumar the IAS favourite for the post, currently in charge of the investigation into the infamous honey-trap scandal.For the moment, opposition leaders are using the issue to hit out at the administration. The government wants yes-men, even if having them affects law and order, says former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Even the Congress seems divided, with state minister for general administration Govind Singh saying DGP Singh was merely fulfilling his duties.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Menon     Chennai February 14, 2020 ISSUE DATE: February 24, 2020UPDATED: February 14, 2020 15:31 IST  Now playing Rajinikanth in ChennaiOn January 14, Tamil superstar Rajinikanth targeted the Dravidar Kazhagam (DK), the springboard that launched both the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) by criticising party ideologue, the revered late Periyar’ E.V. Ramasamy. Rajini’s focus was on Periyar’s distaste for Hindu deities and forms of worship. Expectedly, the Dravidian parties took umbrage, but the superstar refused to back down.On February 5, the actor and wannabe politician called the media to declare that certain political parties were instigating protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA for political gains and that the National Population Register (NPR) was very essential. Just so happens that the release of a new Rajini-starrer Thalaivar 168 is round the corner, and a cursory look at the script of the past couple of years indicates that Rajini’s interest in politics perks up every time a new film is due out.But now there’s the added impetus of the launch of his political party which, sources say, will happen after the puthaandu (Tamil New Year Day on April 14). This is where the anti-Periyar comments, made at the golden jubilee celebrations function for Thuglak magazine (now run by RSS ideologue S. Gurumurthy) and his pro-CAA comments have led some to ask whether an arrangement with the BJP is on the cards. Rajini himself has pooh-poohed the idea, and says he will rally those political forces inimical to the DMK or AIADMK to form a third alternative. Analysts say he is aiming to fill the vacuum left by the passing of top leaders in the two big Dravidian parties. While the DMK, led by the late Karunanidhi’s son M.K. Stalin is still a formidable cadre-based party, the AIADMK, now steered by the duo of chief minister E.K. Palaniswami and his deputy O. Panneerselvam, could find it difficult to hold on to its rank and file as elections near.Rajini has been talking about joining politics and floating a party for over two years now. He has promised aanmiga arasiyal (truthful politics) without elaborating on how he will pursue such a goal. Local committees have also been set up at all levels through his fan clubs, under the aegis of the Rajini Makkal Mandram. For many years now, the actor had also reportedly been in regular touch with Cho Ramaswamy (the late Thuglak editor) and his successor Gurumurthy.G. Palanithurai, former head of political science and development administration at Gandhigram Rural Institute in Dindigul, feels the time is ripe for a change. The people are disillusioned with the corruption in the two big Dravidian parties. The BJP will back him. Smaller parties will also join Rajini, as they did with the People’s Welfare Front steered by DMDK’s Vijayakanth in 2016. The Dravidian ethos has faded, this will help Rajini against his critics, he says.Meanwhile, on the acting front, Rajini’s films have not exactly been raking it in the way they did in the past. Indeed, his latest release, Darbar, which came out on January 9, did so poorly that the film’s distributors protested outside his house demanding compensation.Rajini’s critics say his always imminent shift to politics is just a lot of hype. He projects himself as a natural alternative to the bad Dravidian model of governance’, but he has not backed it with anything concrete. As of now, he has nothing new to offer, says political analyst N. Sathiya Moorthy. Also, his rivals will surely go on the offensive over his recent income tax case. It can seriously dent his Mr Clean image.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?    Awesome!

The focus, says a senior leader, is to expand the party’s base, which has long been seen as a party of Muslims and Yadavs. Leader of the opposition and Lalu’s chosen heir Tejashwi Yadav said as much on February 9 when he described the RJD as a party of A to Z, and not just of some caste and communities.As part of this plan, the RJD has given 45 per cent reservation to members of Scheduled Castes and Tribes and the Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs) in party posts. For the first time since its formation, the RJD has more EBCs (14) heading its district units than Yadavs (12). There are also six Muslim district presidents.The RJD’s focus on EBCs, the core supporters of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s JD(U), is understandable. Even though it enjoys the support of the Yadavs and can count on a sizeable chunk of the state’s Muslim voters, this M-Y combination’ has repeatedly failed to win the state for the RJD. This is largely because Nitish has a similar consolidation of EBCs and Mahadalits behind him.The RJD knew that with its 2014 tally of about 30 per cent votes, it was no match for the NDA in Bihar, says an RJD leader. The way forward was to empower new leaders from other social groups. Instead, we chose to lean on leaders of smaller caste-based parties like Mukesh Sahni, Jitan Ram Manjhi and Upendra Kushwaha. We depended on them and when they failed, we too failed.The first winds of change were visible in November 2019 when the RJD chose upper-caste Rajput leader Jagdanand Singh to head its state unit in Bihar. It was quite a shift for a party that had even last year protested a 10 per cent reservation for the upper castes.Singh was brought in just a month after the RJD won two of the five assembly seats that went for bypolls. For a party that had seen a wipeout in the Lok Sabha election, the victories came as the first signs of a revival.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Within three months of the launch, it had become a hit. The duo told the cops they had tied up with local vendors and were able to deliver liquor in Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali within 30 minutes of an order. Some four years later, the two are still facing trial even as the Punjab government has decided to test the model. The new excise policy has zeroed in on Mohali to try out the online delivery model.Punjab, known for its Patiala pegs’, with annual per capita consumption at 7.9 litres, is next only to Kerala (8.4 litres) in its fondness for liquor. And Mohali, home to students and young professionals is fertile ground for this experiment. But it won’t be easy or risk-free.The government knows this and is treading cautiously. Recent findings of a survey by the National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre at AIIMS, New Delhi, highlights the pitfalls. According to the survey, some 120,000 minors, in the 10-17 age group, in Punjab consume alcohol. The Capt. Amarinder Singh-led Congress government is also aware that drugs and intoxicants were a major political issue in the previous assembly election. The state excise department is communicating with major liquor vendors, and says the new policy will not be implemented if there is any resistance.The opposition Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) is already raising a hue and cry. It says the proposal violates Article 47 of the Constitution, which says that states should endeavour to implement prohibition, making an exception only for medicinal use. Party secretary Daljit Singh Cheema says that for a government that came to power promising jobs for the youth of every household, this policy is completely counter-productive.But for cash-strapped Punjab, excise on liquor is a big source of revenue. This year, the state expects to rake in Rs 5,676 crore, while the new excise policy promises over Rs 6,250 crore next year. The home delivery scheme could be a big money-spinner.Punjab is not the first state to toy with the idea. The previous Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP government in Maharashtra had also come up with a proposal to sell liquor online, but it fell through. Karnataka too tried, and failed. Given this history and the fact that other major liquor-consuming states, such as Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Haryana, are looking at ways to limit availability, the Punjab proposal is not likely to be popular.Advocates of the online liquor delivery proposal argue that it would promote responsible consumption, which echoes the Fadnavis government’s logic that it would curb drunk driving.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " \" Jump to navigation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n The killing fieldsRajasthan’s farms have borne the brunt of the damage caused by locust swarms since December last year.advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Rohit Parihar     Rajasthan February 14, 2020 ISSUE DATE: February 24, 2020UPDATED: February 14, 2020 15:29 IST  On February 7, Union minister for agriculture Narendra Singh Tomar informed the Rajya Sabha that almost 170,000 hectares of crop in Rajasthan and Gujarat had been damaged by locust swarms in the past few months, with about 80 per cent of the damage reported from Rajasthan. As much as 88 per cent of affected land saw crop loss of 33 per cent or more, with almost 135,000 hectares in Rajasthan sustaining severe damage.Although this problem has been months in the making, its arrival in India seems to have caught officials unprepared. Locust swarms were first reported as migrating east from Yemen, Saudi Arabia and southwest Iran as early as January 2019, with early reports of their arrival in India in May. Nonetheless, the central and state governments spent the past two months passing the buck before settling on blaming Pakistan for not issuing warnings early enough. However, a bulletin published by the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization on December 18 last year warned that swarms of adult locusts were expected to soon arrive in India from southwest Pakistan.So far, at least two countries, Somalia and Pakistan have declared national emergencies. On February 4, Rajasthan minister for revenue Harish Chaudhury wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging that India follow suit and declare the locust swarms a national calamity’. About 150,000 hectares of crop in the state have been damaged. Crops affected include cumin, mustard, isabgol, taramira, castor and wheat. About 54,000 affected farmers have been identified to receive compensation, with the Rajasthan government allocating about Rs 100 crore for the purpose. Revenue minister Chaudhury says that Union and state governments were caught off guard, with [the state] machinery collapsing. Farmers saved their crops with their own efforts. In Rajasthan, the maximum damage has been reported in Jalore district, with about 60,000 hectares of farmland affected. Jaisalmer saw damage to 55,000 hectares, with 30,000 hectares in Barmer and 1,000 hectares each in Jodhpur and Sri Ganganagar districts also affected. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has reportedly released about Rs 100 crore as compensation through the state disaster management fund, though estimates of total damage exceed Rs 150 crore. State officials expect that farmers will also receive further compensation through crop insurance schemes.India last faced a major locust threat in 2007. Locust control is largely the Centre’s responsibility. The Locust Warning Organisation (LWO), established 1939, is headquartered in Jodhpur and tasked with monitoring and controlling the insects in the desert areas of Rajasthan and Gujarat. It also liaises with other agencies concerned. However, the LWO field centres are crippled by shortages of staff and machines, with equipment both old and obsolete. State governments have had to supplement these, with Rajasthan providing 100 vehicles for surveys, 450 sprayer-mounted tractors for control operations and 50,000 litres of pesticides. The government has also deployed drones to spray insecticides, but has avoided doing so with helicopters for fear of causing ecological damage. However, ground reports suggest that indiscriminate use of pesticides by farmers has caused significant soil and groundwater pollution.While minor locust infestations were reported last summer, authorities were slow to react. Experts suspect that this allowed locusts to breed, with new swarms also reportedly entering into Gujarat through uninhabited areas on the Indo-Pakistani border. Although attempts were made to control the problem fire engines were used to spray trees sheltering locusts at night factors such as an unfavourable wind direction made the problem worse. The direction of the wind is significant in determining the course a locust swarm takes; it is therefore difficult to predict the direction a swarm will migrate in. Another factor to bear in mind is that locust swarms can travel as much as 150 km in a single day, given favourable winds. These insects are also voracious eaters. A very small swarm’, say reports, can consume as much as 35,000 people can in a single day.For the opposition BJP in Rajasthan, the problem has presented an opportunity to charge the state government with poor governance. On January 24, BJP MLA Bihari Lal entered the Vidhan Sabha premises carrying a basket full of locusts to highlight the problem. On the other hand, state officials say their efforts with some help from the wind prevented damage at a much larger scale.On February 3, Union MoS for agriculture Parshottam Khodabhai Rupala informed the Rajya Sabha that the government would invite representatives from 30 locust-affected countries to prepare a roadmap to deal with the problem in future. Although the bigger swarms seem to have gone, for now, the UN and the Government of India are both expecting a rerun of the crisis around the monsoon. Hopefully, by then, state and central officials will have implemented coordinated mechanisms to deal with the threat.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Bipin Rawat explains why he will be the armed forces officer to watch as he drives reform in the defence ministry. Excerpts from an exclusive interview with Sandeep Unnithan:On creating new integrated tri-services theatre commands: We will have theatre commands by 2021-22. Whether you have only western commands or two western commands or two China commands or one China command, will depend on various factors. We are carrying out a complete analysis of these areas and, then, we will see what resources are needed.On how Indian Air Force (IAF) fighter planes will be distributed in theatre commands: In the army, a division has a smaller artillery brigade, but when it goes in to attack, it gets multiple artillery units from elsewhere. This is one model to look at. Some resources (fighter aircraft) are available with a theatre command for training and familiarisation. The rest are with the air chief as reserves. If a theatre becomes the fulcrum of operations, then the air force chief deploys his reserves into it. All theatre commanders will initially report to the service chiefs. In the long run, when the forces are fully integrated, they will report to a CDS who has served in naval and air force billets.On joint training: Today, we are doing joint training at staff course level (Majors and equivalent) and at National Defence College level (Brigadiers and equivalent), but not at the higher command level (Colonels and equivalent). This is where we need to start training together to start understanding all the services well. I didn't know the capabilities of a Sukhoi till I became an army commander. I learned of the capabilities of a P-8I aircraft only when the navy offered it for a mission during Doklam (the standoff). We need to understand each other's platforms and capabilities. For instance, an AWACS is not just an eye in the sky, it also has ears and can locate an armoured division.On consulting the three Service chiefs about theatre commands: I have begun discussions with them but we are yet to have a formal sit down. In my mind, I'm very clear about what I want but I want to discuss it with them before I speak. They might have better ideas than me. If not, then what I have in mind will be what goes. The decision has to be taken by someone. As of now, we are reorganising the Department of Military Affairs.On the need to prioritise modernisation with existing budgets: Budget is more of a management issue than a funds issue. In the past three years, the army had deficiencies in modern equipment, ammunition and Married Accommodation Projects (MAPs). We gave weapons and ammunition higher priority. Now if we gave MAPs a higher priority, we would be in trouble. Buying whatever is available with the money you have in hand is not the way. You have to be serious about what you want, focus on it and then spend.On managing the pension burden: Jawans are being retired at the age of 37 and 38. After a hard life in service, they are left high and dry. We are considering increasing the retirement age to 58 in certain services-like giving them priority for reemployment in Defence Service Corps (static duties). One-third of the army can be retired at 58 years. We are presently giving them 30 years of pension for 17 years of service. Why not reverse it to 20 years of pension for 38 years of service? All services have been asked to submit their proposals to me by year-end.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Tare  Mumbai February 7, 2020 ISSUE DATE: February 17, 2020UPDATED: February 7, 2020 14:51 IST  People\\'s CM Uddav Thackeray at a Shiv Sena felicitation event in Mumbai (Photo: Mandar Deodhar)A fortnight after he took charge as Maharashtra chief minister on November 28 last year, Uddhav Thackeray told bureaucrats at a meeting in Mantralaya, the administrative headquarters of the state government, that he wanted to rid Mumbai of \"visual pollution\". As bureaucrats looked on, he explained that he abhorred the unplanned construction, poorly maintained structures and filth in the city, and wanted to spruce up Mumbai.Two months into office, as Thackeray begins to get a grip on the administration and outlines his vision for Maharashtra, a few things are clear: a revamp of Mumbai, stronghold of the Shiv Sena, will receive his special attention. The new chief minister is also keen to be seen as an accessible administrator.Political observers were puzzled when Thackeray agreed to give his allies, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress, the most plum portfolios. The Sena has direct control over only two major portfolios-urban development and agriculture. The rest, including home, finance, public works, revenue, power, water resources, education, health and tribal development, are with the allies.A Sena insider says Thackeray\\'s priority is to strengthen the party in Mumbai. In the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections due in February 2022, he wants the party to win over a hundred out of the 227 seats. With an annual budget of around Rs 25,000 crore, the BMC is the richest civic body in Asia. \"Two years may seem like a long period, but we want to focus on the BMC election from now,\" says the insider.Thackeray has made son and tourism minister Aaditya a \\'guardian minister\\' for the Mumbai Suburban district, though he was elected MLA from the Mumbai City district. In the BMC election held in 2017, the BJP had posed a big challenge to the Sena in Mumbai\\'s suburbs, bagging 82 seats, just two short of the Sena\\'s tally. As a guardian minister has authority to plan a district\\'s annual expenditure, Aaditya is expected to pump money into areas where the Sena hopes to reap benefits in the next BMC election. A planning meeting of the Mumbai Suburban district that Aaditya chaired on January 22 okayed development works for an estimated Rs 3,000 crore.The government\\'s key initiatives in Mumbai include segregation of waste, planting 400,000 saplings of Indian origin in 65 areas, revival of the \\'Mumbai Eye\\' project on the lines of the London Eye, and a Rs 100 crore industrial training institute.According to the Sena insider, Thackeray wants to showcase \"constructive work\" in a bid to placate a wide section of party sympathisers who are upset with him for joining hands with the Congress and NCP and veering off the Hindutva agenda. \"Thackeray gave the NCP and the Congress an upper hand in government as part of a conscious strategy. He wanted the government to be stable so that he can focus on his priorities,\" says the insider.Congress legislator Anant Gadgil says the Congress should learn from the Sena and give priority to the urban areas, where it has been losing support.Thackeray has also mounted a public relations exercise to project himself as a people\\'s leader. Once a week, he meets commoners at the Mantralaya, hearing out their grievances. He called over a 21-year-old Dombivali student who sells peanuts, and assured him of financial assistance for his education. \"The chief minister has instructed us to read each and every letter to the editor published in local newspapers and report to him about public opinion and complaints,\" says an official in Thackeray\\'s office.Thackeray has initiated various reforms to decentralise power. Within a month of the announcement on December 21, chief minister\\'s sub-offices have been set up at each of the six revenue headquarters, where officials receive public complaints and forward them to respective departments. \"I do not want people to travel all the way to Mumbai for problems that can be solved locally,\" Thackeray has said. Agriculture assistance centres have come up in all 36 districts of the state. The chief minister has, on similar lines, mooted disaster management cells in each district.Sources say Thackeray has conveyed to his ministers that he will not interfere in their departments\\' day-to-day work unless it is a policy matter. In his very first meeting with bureaucrats, he made it clear that he will sign a file only after the chief secretary clears it and that no minister or bureaucrat should approach him directly bypassing set protocol and procedure. A senior bureaucrat sees Thackeray as a quick learner. \"We were sceptical at first as he used to step into office only towards the afternoon. But he has moulded himself and is showing interest in administration,\" he says. A Congress leader, however, argues that Thackeray\\'s approach will give the bureaucracy too much power and reduce ministers to rubber stamps.So far, Thackeray has managed to keep relations between the allies fairly smooth, stepping in, if need be, to douse fires. When Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut claimed that former prime minister Indira Gandhi used to visit underworld don Karim Lala in Mumbai, Thackeray got Aaditya to pacify Congress leaders. Aaditya called on Raut and conveyed to him that Thackeray wanted him to issue a quick clarification that he had great respect for the late leader. \"One does not need to give history references all the time,\" Aaditya also said, in a public snub to Raut.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

There could still be a large number of poor people who do not know their parents\\' date and place of birth.\"The new NPR exercise, scheduled this year, has 21 questions, six more than in the last such exercise in 2010. Some of the new questions, such as the place and date of birth of parents, have triggered a political storm, with opposition parties claiming the Modi government seeks these additional details for potential exclusionary use in the NRC to be compiled at a later date.In Bihar, the NPR is likely to begin in May, just four months before the assembly election. While respondents have the option of not answering some of the questions-in which case, the enumerator will mark them with a dash-there is speculation that blank responses may go against individuals during the NRC. \"We want the Centre to revert to the old NPR format to eliminate speculation among people,\" says a leader of the Janata Dal-United or JD(U).With 16 Lok Sabha MPs, the JD(U) is the sec\\xadond largest constituent of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). The party had voted in favour of the CAA in Parliament last December. Thereafter, however, Nitish has signalled that his support cannot be taken for granted. He rejected the NRC on January 13-and has now gone public with his position on the NPR.Nitish\\'s NPR demand came the very day he iss\\xadued a warning to JD(U) vice-president Prashant Kishor and veteran Pavan K. Varma over their public criticism of the CAA. Kishor and Varma were expelled from the JD(U) the next day. The two developments should not be seen in isolation. \"Prashant Kishor has been an ace campaign strategist. There is a distinct possibility that he may now team up with the opposition for the Bihar assembly poll. So we cannot leave our position on crucial issues vague and allow our opponents to exploit it,\" says the JD(U) leader.Kishor, after his expulsion, tweeted his gratitude to Nitish and extended his best wishes for retaining the chief ministerial chair. Many in the JD(U) see it as a sarcastic jibe and do not rule out Kishor mounting a challenge against the party in the assembly poll. \"We are ready. Let Kishor make his intentions clear after the Delhi election,\" says another JD(U) leader.Bihar\\'s parties are already warming up for the state poll. Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav is likely to launch his Berozgari Hatao (Remove Unemployment) Yatra whereas the Samvidhan Bachao (Save the Constitution) Yatra announced by Communist Party of India (CPI) leader Kanhaiya Kumar against the CAA is under way. Nitish has held consultations with his party members in January. The JD(U) is focusing on stepping up preparedness at the booth level.Home minister Amit Shah has announced that Nitish will lead the NDA campaign in the Bihar assembly election. Having won 39 of the 40 seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the alliance holds a psychological edge against the conglomeration of opposition parties. A senior JD(U) leader, however, told India Today that though the opposition was decimated in the general election, the assembly contest may be far from one-sided. \"We are aware that efforts are being made to get Kanhaiya Kumar to join hands with Tejashwi. Unlike the Lok Sabha election, the opposition alliance may also take the left parties on board for the assembly poll. We cannot afford to be complacent,\" said the leader.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

The mutt, custodian of the famous Lord Venkateswara temple in Tirumala till 1933, when the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) was formed, has been embroiled in legal battles over its land and properties. The estimated value of the mutt's properties across the country is a staggering Rs 50,000 crore. With the mahant allegedly turning a blind eye to the mismanagement of assets, land sharks have grabbed some of the land with conniving politicians. Some assets have also been disposed of unlawfully, flouting the provisions of the Andhra Pradesh Charitable and Hindu Religious Institutions and Endowment Act. Political parties are now calling for a comprehensive probe into the allegations. The 2,000-plus years old Sri Venkateswara temple is the richest Hindu shrine and is growing richer by the year.

On Friday, the Rajasthan High Court quashed the FIRs against main investor Navratan Kothari, ex-deputy election commissioner of India Vinod Zutshi, IAS officer Hridyesh Kumar and others for fraud and conspiracy in the award of the contract. Says Kothari, 78, who was arr\\xadested in the case once in 2013, \"At my age, all I wish is to give Jaipur a magnificent palace before I die, not make money....\"Located between the Amer Fort and the Pink City, the man-made lake built by Jaipur\\'s rulers between the 16th and 18th centuries, got entangled in the political tussle between Ashok Gehlot-then a Congress chief minister in his first tenure in 2000-and his successor from the BJP, Vasundhara Raje. The Gehlot government finalised the bids just before the poll results came out in December 2003 and Raje gave it the go-ahead in February 2004. Subsequ\\xadently, though, she did an about-turn. A series of cases were filed at various stages, with Gehlot failing to get it completed even during his second tenure (2008-13) and Raje failing to get it cancelled it in her term (2013-18).KGK Enterprises, a consortium of companies, had won the award for cleaning and maintaining the lake, restoring and renovating the palace and building two hotels and a handicrafts bazaar. While Jaipur-based jeweller and real estate baron Kothari is the patriarch, some of the other companies in the consortium had links to Mofatraj Munot, owner of the Mumbai-based Rs 5,000 crore Kalpataru group. Given Munot\\'s family ties with Gehlot, the BJP cried favouritism in the award of contracts. The allegations included handing over of land worth Rs 3,500 crore, waiving of Rs 65 crore stamp duty and making changes in the project design. Kothari told india today that all the charges were false and that he never intended to exceed the construction beyond the approved 13 per cent of the total land area.The courts also gave inconsistent verd\\xadicts over the years in different cases. As the high court said in its latest judgment, in 2010, one magistrate ordered an FIR after three different investigating officers had concluded that no offence was committed. Meanwhile, KGK renovated and restored the lake where sewage of the city was dumped, and took up other work on the palace and setting up of decantation tanks to clean sewage. But the high court, responding to a PIL, stayed the works in 2011 and, a year later, struck down the project. Meanwhile, the apex court upheld the contract in 2014 but in another judgment refused to quash the FIR from 2010. The Raje government, then, tried to get the lake declared a protected area in 2015, but the KGK group got a status quo order against it in court.Kothari, who says he has already spent Rs 150 crore on the project, says he will now move the apex court to get a status quo order on his contempt plea removed following quashing of the criminal case. Ajay Kumar Jain, the lawyer who has been pursuing various cases including the one that the high court decided, says he too will move the apex court against the quashing of the FIR.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

(Photo: ANI)Addressing back-to-back ral\\xadl\\xad\\xadies in Delhi\\'s Rithala and Janakpuri areas on January 27, Union home minister Amit Shah asked Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal if he was in favour of arresting Sharjeel Imam, the student-activist facing sedition charges in five states over his controversial remarks at Aligarh Muslim University (a rambling speech during which he took potshots at the Left and the Right and then sug\\xadgested a blockade to cut off the Northeast to protest the condition of Muslims there). \"Kejriwalji, are you in favour of action against Sharjeel Imam or not? Make it clear to the people of Delhi,\" Shah said in one of his speeches.Within minutes, Kejriwal took to Twitter and asked what was stopping Shah from arresting Sharjeel. \"...or do you have to do more dirty politics now\" the Delhi CM tweeted. The trading of charges and the verbal sparring between Shah and Kejriwal have visibly escalated in the last leg of campaigning for the Delhi assembly election.With less than ten days to go for the February 8 polls, the BJP, which is yet to announce a chief ministerial candidate, has put all its might behind a late tactical manoeuvre to make Shah\\'s hard line on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 or CAA -- and Kejriwal\\'s ambivalence on the subject -- a pivot of their campaign. This marks a clear departure from its earlier strategy, where the BJP, which has been out of power in Delhi for more than two decades, was banking on Prime Minister Narendra Modi\\'s outsized image to put it past Kejriwal who is seeking a third term after a curtailed 49 days in office and the landslide win in 2015 (67 out of 70 seats). In the last week of December, days before election dates were announced, the BJP\\'s Delhi unit had launched a massive publicity drive to highlight the Modi government\\'s decision to regularise unauthorised colonies. It put up thousands of hoardings in these settlements, which have some 4 million residents, flashing the promise and the PM\\'s face as a tacit endorsement of it. Modi had also launched the BJP\\'s campaign with a rally in Ramlila Maidan in December.But things started changing on the ground on January 23, with Shah hitting the campaign trail. As many as 343 public meetings were held on January 25 and another 250 on January 26. In the first three days, Shah was part of 11 poll-related programmes, including nukkad sabhas (street corner meetings). Taking over from Modi as the face of the BJP\\'s campaign, which had by now assumed an openly communal and vitriolic character (BJP MP from West Delhi, Parvesh Verma, was talking of how the Shaheen Bagh protesters would \"enter your houses, rape your sisters and daughters, and kill them\"), Shah, in rally after rally, accused Kejriwal of misleading the people of Delhi, claiming AAP\\'s promises of free wi-fi and quality education was all hogwash.Kejriwal, who had carefully avoided any anti-Modi rhetoric and chosen to focus on his governance plank, released a video message on January 26 asking Shah to stop humiliating the people of Delhi. \"For the last few days, Amit Shahji has been coming here to campaign daily and insult the people of Delhi. This is not right. In the past five years, the people of Delhi have worked very hard to improve our city,\" the chief minister said in the video. Political analyst Sanjay Kumar of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) says the BJP\\'s decision to now foreground Shah is a deliberate strategy to shield PM Modi. \"The BJP has changed its campaign style. They have moved from Modi to Shah as far as state elections are concerned,\" says Kumar. (A BJP leader who did not want to be named said Modi might address a rally or two in the first week of February after the budget session is over.)At the time of going to press, it looked like the BJP\\'s poll campaign was no longer centred on governance promises, but rather on issues such as the scrapping of Article 370 in J&K, triple talaq and the CAA, all of which have a certain communal flavour. \"The BJP has gone back to the basics, furthering its larger narrative of nationalism. If the polls get any more polarised in the days to come, it will damage AAP,\" says Kumar.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Mahajan  January 31, 2020 ISSUE DATE: February 10, 2020UPDATED: January 31, 2020 13:46 IST  CHANGE OF GUARD: Parkash Singh Badal (left) with son Sukhbir. (Photo: Prabhjot Bill)On January 18, rebelling Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leaders met at Delhi\\'s Constitution Club to stitch together a coalition to challenge Sukhbir Badal\\'s leadership of the party. They had already identified SAD\\'s Rajya Sabha MP, Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, to anchor this coalition. Sukhdev, who for three decades had occupied the position of party secretary general, resigned in October last year from the leadership of the SAD in the Rajya Sabha. Soon after, his son, Parminder Singh Dhindsa, gave up his post as chief of the party unit in the Punjab assembly.Politically, the SAD has been struggling to enthuse its core base -- panthic voters, who are more alive to issues relating to the Sikh faith. Badal\\'s rivals have accused the party of mishandling the fallout of the June 2015 desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib. There were public protests and the police had opened fire on protesters in Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan in Faridkot. Punjab was governed by a BJP-SAD coalition at the time.Speaking to India Today, Sukhbir insists that, politically speaking, the worst was over for the SAD, though many of his party colleagues disagree. To illustrate, they point out that in mid-January, similar unrest was witnessed when PTC Punjabi, a TV channel owned by the Badals, claimed intellectual property rights over the daily hukamnama telecast from the Golden Temple. This really angered the Sikh community. \"The SAD cannot afford another religious controversy,\" points out an Akali Dal legislator. With the assembly election just two years away, the party needs to plan its revival strategy soon, or risk giving ally BJP more bargaining power and, worse, strengthening the hand of the ruling Congress.Sukhbir is aware that recent events have made reviving the party\\'s fortunes more difficult. His father, five-time Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, now 92, has been staying away from public appearances. Other challenges include former party stalwarts Ranjit Singh Brahmpura, Rattan Singh Ajnala and Sewa Singh Sekhwan, who, following their sacking from the SAD in late 2018, formed the Shiromani Akali Dal (Taksali) in December the same year. These leaders have influence with voters in the Majha region-which consists of the Gurdaspur, Amritsar and Tarn Taran districts in northwest Punjab. Worse, leaders of other Akali factions-such as Paramjit Singh Sarna, Manjit Singh G.K. and Ravi Inder Singh-appear to be aligning themselves with the Dhindsas. Sukhbir argues that these leaders don\\'t have mass appeal, but they are pulling away, and it could only weaken the party.Sukhbir Badal is aware that the exit of top SAD leaders has made the task of reviving the party much more difficult.In the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the SAD managed to win just two seats -- Ferozepur and Bathinda, won by Sukhbir and his wife, Harsimrat Kaur Badal, respectively -- despite a slight uptick in its overall vote share from 26.3 per cent to 27.5 per cent. What is especially worrying is that apart from these seats, the SAD was not a major contender in the state\\'s Malwa region, which accounts for 69 seats in the 117-seat assembly. While Sukhdev Dhindsa might not have a huge voter base around his pocket borough in Sangrur (in the Malwa belt), his exit will complicate matters. His understanding of religious issues made him indispensable to the SAD and his exit will mean a longer recovery period for the party among panthic voters in the region.Sukhbir disagrees with that assessmen -- but according to Parminder Dhindsa, \"that is exactly the problem.\" Sukhdev Dhindsa elaborates: \"I requested SAD leaders to offer an apology to the Akal Takht. Initially, they agreed, but they eventually did not go.\" Parminder says: \"It would not have been an admission of guilt, but would have pacified the agitators.\"Worse, the SAD\\'s allies may also be looking to profit from its troubles. On January 17, at an event in Jalandhar to elect new state BJP chief Ashwani Sharma, many leaders spoke of abandoning the BJP-SAD alliance. Although the party leadership is treading cautiously on the issue of abandoning an ally of two decades, especially given the recent split between the BJP and its allies in Maharashtra and Jharkhand, this will not prevent BJP leaders from opening channels with the new Akali Dal (Taksali).For over two decades, thanks to its strength in the state, the SAD managed to retain a leadership position in its alliance with the BJP. However, BJP leaders believe that recent results -- such as the increase in the alliance\\'s vote share in the 2019 Lok Sabha election -- are a result of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\\'s popularity. This could encourage new alliances -- such as with the Dhindsa-led Akali Dal (Taksali). The first overtures in this regard appear to have come from the Centre. In January 2019, the Union government honoured Sukhdev Dhindsa with the Padma Bhushan -- and in his bid to stitch together a new alliance, Dhindsa has avoided taking potshots at the BJP while training his fire on the Badals. Further, on January 20, the BJP snapped ties with the SAD for the Delhi election, and is in touch with the rebels for support in the assembly poll.Dhindsa\\'s new status as an opposition leader close to the BJP could also upset the Badal family\\'s fortunes when it comes to the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee. Elections to this body, which administers gurudwaras in Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, including the Golden Temple, have been due since 2016, with the Amit Shah-led home ministry yet to decide on a date.For the moment, the BJP appears happy to wait for the Dhindsas to build a new Akali Dal and attract panthic votes. The BJP has frequently used a combination of such voters with its own base to win key urban centres such as Jalandhar, Bathinda, Patiala and Ludhiana. \"We can do it for the new [breakaway] Akali Dal as well,\" says a top BJP leader.Sukhbir dismisses the conjecture. \"We have clear alliance terms,\" he says. \"They know their 23 assembly seats, we have our 94. Similarly, we have a 10-3 arrangement for the general election. This will continue.\"Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?    Awesome!

(Photo: Sonu Kishan)It\\'s an election year and Nitish Kumar knows it well. He sounded conciliatory on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, when senior leaders of his party, the JD(U), Prashant Kishor and Pavan K. Varma, went public with their criticism of the new law but seems to have changed his line after Union home minister Amit Shah paid a visit and declared that Nitish would lead the BJP-JD(U) all\\xadiance in the state election. Likely emboldened by Shah\\'s vote of confid\\xadence, Nitish has ticked off both Kishor and Varma in no uncertain terms, saying they are \"free to leave\" if they want.Speaking in Vaishali dist\\xadrict, Shah, till recently the BJP national president, said he was there to scotch \"all rumours\". \"The NDA will contest the next Bihar poll under Nitishji\\'s leadership. The BJP-JD(U) alliance is unbreakable,\" he said. Shah\\'s statement should silence the handful of state leaders pressing the BJP to stake its claim to the chief minister\\'s post.Just three days before Shah\\'s Bihar visit, Nitish had categorically rejected the need for a National Register of Cit\\xadi\\xadzens (NRC)-of which Shah has been the mascot and most vocal advocate -- and expressed a willingness to have an open debate on the CAA. Many BJP hawks had taken umbrage, and a strong response was expected from Shah. That the usually bellicose Shah let it slide is being seen as a sign of his reluctance to disturb a winning combination.Having recently burnt its fingers in Maharashtra and Jharkhand, the BJP leadership is clearly not up to dealing with another warring ally in another big state; Bihar sends up 40 MPs to the Lok Sabha. Elections are just 10 months away and as a JD(U) leader, who preferred to stay anonymous, says, \"The BJP needs to und\\xaderstand that Nitish, at 68, may be seeking his last term as chief minister. State BJP leaders must have patience and back him.\"8.9 million Votes JD(U) polled in the 2019 general election, a 38.7% jump from its tally in the 2015 assembly pollA deep scrutiny of the 2019 Lok Sabha poll results reveals that the BJP, despite the tally of 17 seats and 9.6 million votes (of the total 40 million), was still not the biggest gainer in the state; Nitish\\'s JD(U), with nearly 9 million votes, was. The BJP got 9.3 million votes in the 2015 state assembly poll which it lost to the RJD-JD(U) alliance. The BJP\\'s 2019 LS vote figures recorded an increase of 310,000 votes. Nitish\\'s JD(U) bagged over 8.9 million votes, an astounding 38.7 per cent leap over its 2015 figures.Bihar has added 6.1 million new voters since the 2014 Lok Sabha election, and the JD(U) leadership believes every second new voter voted for Nitish, one reason why it\\'s not looking for new alliances. \"We cannot be part of a \\'tainted\\' alliance (a reference to RJD leader Lalu Prasad Yadav\\'s conviction in the fodder scam),\" says a JD(U) leader. \"Young voters may not take too kindly to it.\"A section of JD(U) leaders, however, are apprehensive about seat distribution. In the 2010 assembly poll, which Nitish contested in alliance with the BJP, the JD(U) had fielded candidates in 141 seats to the saffron party\\'s 102. In the 2019 general election, the two parties contested an equal number of seats. More importantly, the results -- the BJP won all 17 that it contested -- have apparently put it on an even keel with the JD(U). Seat negotiations are sure to start with the BJP demanding a far bigger share than in 2010. But as the JD(U) leader puts it, \"State elections are all about electing a chief minister.\" And here the party is sure it holds the trump card.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

While the opposition BJP has criticised the move as anti-democratic, Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel says the pension funds will be channelled into development work.The Baghel government\\'s decision comes within weeks of over a hundred beneficiaries of the scheme securing a verdict from the Chhattisgarh High Court for resumption of their pension. The state government had suspended the payments in January last year, calling it political largesse by the Raman Singh-led BJP administration, and ordered a verification of all beneficiaries. The high court struck down the suspension in December.When enacted in 2008, the Loknayak Jaiprakash Narayan (MISA and DIR Detainees) Samman Nidhi Rule provided for a monthly pension of Rs 3,000 for those incarcerated during the Emergency for less than six months. Those who spent more than six months in jail were eligible for Rs 6,000 a month. By 2017, the pension had been revised to Rs 25,000 per month for the 320 beneficiaries, most of whom come from BJP ranks. The scheme costs the state exchequer Rs 9.6 crore annually.Last year, neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, also ruled by the Congress, had suspended a similar pension scheme at around the same time, only to resume it within two months after a verification of the beneficiaries. An estimated 2,000 people receive the pension in MP. Among them are top BJP leaders, such as former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and former ministers Sartaj Singh and Ajay Vishnoi. The state government spends about Rs 60 crore annually on the pension scheme.Rs 9.6 crore Annual cost incurred by the Chhattisgarh government on the pension schemeChhattisgarh advocate general Satish Chandra Verma defends the Baghel government\\'s decision. \"The detentions made [during the Emergency] were as per the prevailing laws. These detainees are not freedom fighters. If they are honoured for breaking the law, governance is bound to suffer.\"BJP state vice-president Sachidanand Upasane, however, decried the move as an insult to those who had stood up to uphold democracy during the Emergency. \"The Congress government in Chhattisgarh has been against this pension from the beginning. Its decision smacks of vendetta and is also in contempt of court. We will challenge it legally,\" said Upasane, who is also national vice-president of the Loktantra Senani Sangh, an outfit whose members include political detainees from the Emergency period.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Tare  January 24, 2020 ISSUE DATE: February 3, 2020UPDATED: January 24, 2020 15:46 IST  PAWAR PLAY Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar (Photo credit: MANDAR DEODHAR)Soon after assuming office as Maharashtra deputy chief minister on December 30, 2019, Ajit Pawar demanded that his allotted office in Mantralaya be changed. The cabin he had been assigned, #602, is considered \\'inauspicious\\'. Three former occupants-Eknath Khadse, Pandurang Fundkar and Anil Bonde-have suffered political setbacks as incumbents. (However, Pawar brushed aside the suggestion that he was being superstitious, saying, \"I chose another cabin [to be closer] to the chief secretary\\'s-if the chief minister calls a meeting, it\\'ll be more convenient for me to attend.\")Pawar looks to be attempting an image makeover to establish himself as an inclusive leader and stern administrator. On the first count, on January 1, despite being an advocate of Maratha dominance, Pawar made a point to travel to Koregaon-Bhima to pay homage to Dalit soldiers on the anniversary of that conflict. The next day, he visited the site of the memorial to Dalit icon B.R. Ambedkar to review the progress of the construction work.And on January 16, flexing his political muscle, Pawar had close confidant and social justice minister Dhananjay Munde, involved in the monitoring of that project. Until then, the Rs 3,000 crore project had been the sole responsibility of a department overseen by the urban development minister, Shiv Sena\\'s Eknath Shinde. \\'The design of the memorial is ready. The social justice department will monitor the progress,\\' read a press release.Other unilateral decisions by Pawar have also caught bureaucrats and alliance partners by surprise. This included an announcement that Marathi would likely be made compulsory in schools until class 10 (leaving the minister for school education, Congress\\'s Varsha Gaikwad, in the dark) and a decision to rename Mumbai\\'s eastern freeway after a former CM, the late Vilasrao Deshmukh (going against Shinde\\'s wishes). In a similar vein, on January 17, Pawar announced that a section of the Pune Metro would be renamed the Pune-Pimpri-Chinchwad Metro.Political observers say these moves are Pawar\\'s bid to establish dominance in the government, to stay ahead of party rivals Jayant Patil, Chhagan Bhujbal, Dilip Walse-Patil and Hassan Mushrif, all of whom are ministers. Some say he is, in fact, trying to upstage the \\'inexperienced\\' chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. One such attempt met resistance: on January 16, in his capacity as finance minister, Pawar announced Rs 46 crore in aid for Mumbai\\'s Bai Jerbai Wadia children\\'s hospital, which is facing a financial crisis. Hours later, Thackeray had the sum reduced to Rs 24 crore.Chief Minister Thackeray has, so far, allowed Pawar a free hand, with an official from his office saying the CM is keen to maintain harmony in the cabinet. But this could change if Pawar continues to push the limits of his authority. An official from Pawar\\'s office says he is currently reviewing all government departments as he prepares the state\\'s budget, to be presented in the third week of February. Normally, finance ministers discuss each department\\'s financial requirements with the ministers concerned, but do not review the department\\'s work.Political analyst Hemant Desai points out Pawar has not hid his ambition to lead the state. \"It is clear he is trying to dominate,\" Desai says. Bearing this out, at a rally in Pune on January 19, Pawar compared himself with uncle and NCP supremo Sharad Pawar. \"If saheb (Sharad Pawar) can become CM four times, why can\\'t I become a deputy CM for an equal number?\" he asked. It will be interesting to see how the NCP chief takes this statement.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Ghosh, under whose watch the BJP notched a spectacular tally in the 2019 general election-18 of the state\\'s 42 seats and a 40 per cent vote share-was re-elected state BJP president on January 16.Ghosh was roundly criticised within his own party for first calling CAA protesters \"spineless devils and parasites\" and then asking for them to be \"shot like dogs\". The central leadership apparently cautioned him, the Union minister of state for environment, forests and climate change Babul Supriyo dissociated himself and his party from Ghosh\\'s comments while BJP state vice president Chandra Kumar Bose said \"terror politics has no place in the country\".In fact, it was Supriyo who was being projected as the probable face of the CAA campaign in Bengal, even though he too found himself mired in controversy when he criticised a student online for tearing a copy of the CAA at her convocation in Jadavpur University and then told an Indian Muslim who questioned his reaction that he\\'d give him the answer after he had been \"sent back to his own country\".Yet, the BJP leadership chose to repose their faith in Ghosh, who says that the prime minister and home minister may have \\'cautioned\\' him about his language but never \\'censured\\' him. Finally, Ghosh believes, he was able to convince home minister and BJP national president Amit Shah of the \"need to be aggressive\" in West Bengal. (See accompanying interview.)\"The party had long pondered his election, but there was no option at hand,\" says a senior party leader on condition of anonymity. What about Supriyo? \"Babul is not a man of politics on the ground,\" says the leader. As for other likely contenders for the post, the leader says, \"The party was sceptical about them as they had zero honesty and integrity as far as the party was concerned. At least this man (Ghosh) is 100 per cent committed to the party and its workers.\"\"The party is relying on combative people like Ghosh and Sayantan Bose to take on the aggressive style of functioning of TMC leaders,\" says Prasanto Roy, professor emeritus at Presidency University. By re-electing Ghosh to the top post in the state, Messrs Modi and Shah have endorsed his brand of politics to take on the TMC in the 2020 municipality and the 2021 assembly polls.Indeed, Ghosh\\'s language may be jarring to the Bengali bhadrolok, but it is considered useful to counter the muscle-flexing of Mamata\\'s men-be it Birbhum strongman Anubrata Mandal, who flashed his biceps and threatened to kill opponents, or leaders like Tapas Paul, who spoke of sending boys to rape women who were not with the party. \"The expectation of the middle class,\" says Ray, \"that leaders will speak a refined language has faded. Obscenities have become commonplace over the past two decades or so. Anil Basu and Benoy Kongar of the Left made personal attacks on Mamata in the foulest language.\" Ghosh has been raised in that tradition.His approach has traction in rural Bengal, where he is seen as a gutsy challenger to the TMC. With a vermilion tika on his forehead, saffron/ yellow attire and blatantly communal speech, Ghosh is the ideal mascot for the BJP in Bengal. In response to Mamata\\'s street processions against the CAA, Ghosh is organising abhinandan jatras-BJP worker-processions across the state, ostensibly to canvass support for the CAA, but, in fact, a barely disguised attempt to consolidate the Hindu vote.He is taking the job of polarising Hindus quite seriously, as mandated by his bosses in Delhi. \"This was the only way the BJP could make inroads in Bengal, where appeasement politics over several decades has given rise to feelings of neglect among a section of Hindus. The BJP cleverly used a space left unattended by political parties over time,\" says Sovon Lal Datta Gupta, former political science professor at Calcutta University.Little wonder, then, that Ghosh was elected unanimously by the state committee-there was no other nomination for the post. \"What clinched the deal for Dilipda,\" says Union MoS for Women and Child Development Debasree Chaudhuri, \"is his acceptance among party workers... [and] they found in him a state president fully commit ted to the party\\'s cause.\"Interview: Dilip Ghosh\\'Amit Shah understands the need to be aggressive in Bengal\\'Q. Having been labelled a \\'foul-mouthed\\' politician, how credible will you be as the face of the BJP?Only the media and a few people (intellectuals and bhadrolok) think I am foul-mouthed. Ask those on the ground. \"Go on, dada,\" they say, \"we are with you.\"Q. But how can you justify saying CAA protesters should be shot like dogs?What about the actions of others (Mamata, Buddhababu and Jyoti Basu)-the killing of Kishenji in an encounter, of 11 Gorkhas during the Darjeeling agitation, innocent farmers in Nandigram and immigrants at Marichjhapi?Q. The BJP has re-elected you as state president but seems reluctant to project you as its face in Bengal...In the BJP, the organisation is above the individual and collective leadership is important, whereas parties dependent on one personality (Mamata in Trinamool) or one family (Gandhis in Congress) have to lean on them as they have no options.Q. Word is the party is looking to get someone from outside to counter Mamata\\'s popularity?The party will not drop anyone from heaven. They will choose somebody who has been a product of the party.Q. How will you convince people of a unified BJP when your party leaders are criticising you publicly?Initially, Modiji cautioned me about my speeches. Now he too has realised this is how it should be. I told Amitji that if 92 of my party workers have been brutally killed, don\\'t expect me to go to Belur Math and meditate. Now, even he has understood the need to be aggressive in Bengal.Q. The Left alleges a Modi-Didi understanding, given the slow investigation in the Narada-Saradha scams.What harm will busting the Narada and Saradha scams do to Trinamool? The party won in 2016 because people were not concerned about money going into the pockets of leaders. They were getting rice at Rs 2 a kilo, a cycle for every household, student stipends, etc.Q. Is BJP feeling the heat of CAA and TMC protests?On the contrary, it has worked to our advantage. The CAA has resulted in a vertical split on the basis of religion.

Breakfast time at an anganwadi in Bhopal (Photo credit: PANKAJ TIWARI)A proposal to introduce egg in the menu of children and lactating mothers registered with the 97,135 anganwadis in Madhya Pradesh has run into a controversy. While the Kamal Nath government says eggs will help fight malnutrition, the opposition BJP terms it an assault on culture and an attempt to promote non-vegetarianism.The new meal menu is to be introduced in the next financial year, initially covering 89 of the 333 tribal blocks in the state. Children in the 1-6 age group and lactating mothers will get three eggs a week. The woman and child development department says introducing eggs in the 89 blocks will cost Rs 113 crore annually. Some 6.2 million children (up to the age of 6) and 700,000 lactating mothers are registered with the state\\'s anganwadis.While opposition leader Gopal Bhargava shocked everyone with his manifestly absurd claim that children eating eggs could \"turn cannibals\", some Jain and Vaishya groups, too, are upset. \"In Jainism, consuming egg amounts to jeev hatya (killing of animals). Introducing eggs when vegetarian protein options are available is inexplicable,\" says Pradeep Kasliwal, head of the Digambar Jain Social Group Federation, which has 60,000 members in eight states. The group has made representations to Nath and the governor.Taking on the egg naysayers, the Right to Food campaign has submitted to Nath 118,000 signatures, from 17 districts, in support of introducing eggs.Politics aside, the government\\'s intentions seem above board. According to the National Family Health Survey IV, released in 2016, MP was ranked third-last in the country in child nutrition (6 months to 6 years), with 43 per cent children underweight, 42 per cent stunted and 26 per cent affected by wasting or acute malnutrition. The proportion of underweight children was the highest among tribals (51.5 per cent), followed by Scheduled Castes (45.9 per cent). Among Hindus, it was 43 per cent, 39.9 per cent among Muslims and 18.7 per cent among Jains.But is introducing eggs enough to beat malnutrition? \"An analysis of the 2005-2016 period suggests it will take 50-60 years to wipe out malnutrition from MP. The interventions need to be scaled up,\" says Sachin Jain, director of voluntary group Vikas Samvad. If need be, a campaign will be run to help fund eggs in anganwadi menus, he adds.The state has offered to \\'compen\\xadsate\\' vegetarians with fruits like ban\\xad\\xadana. What\\'s good about eggs, experts argue, is that it is a nutrient-rich \\'sup\\xaderfood\\' that is easily available and ideal for rural areas that lack refrigerated storage. \"Also, there\\'s no resistance to our plan in the 89 tribal blocks,\" says Anupam Rajan, principal secretary, women and child development.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Tare  Mumbai January 17, 2020 ISSUE DATE: January 27, 2020UPDATED: January 17, 2020 12:01 IST  PROMISES TO KEEP: CM Uddhav Thackeray. (Photo by: Mandar Deodhar)When Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced the waiver of all farm loans up to Rs 2 lakh on December 21, he was aware this would put a Rs 30,000 crore burden on the state exchequer. He has already written a letter to Prime Minister Nar\\xadendra Modi, urging him to release the state\\'s share of Rs 17,000 crore in Goods and Service Tax (GST) revenues.The loan waiver comes at a time when the state is reeling under a huge debt of Rs 4.71 lakh crore, 17 per cent of the state gross domestic product (SGDP), which is just six percentage points below the cap set by the RBI. A finance department note from December 2019 states that Maharashtra spends 59 per cent of its income on salaries, pension and interest on debt.As per government estimates, around 4 million farmers will benefit from the loan waiver. According to some estimates, the government will have to cut budgetary allocations of other departments by at least 20 per cent if it wants to implement the loan waiver. \"We are committed to making the farmers debt-free,\" says Thackeray. But an NCP minister says loan waivers are a cosmetic solution. He argues that if the crop loan scheme is effectively implemented, the farmers will require minimum loans. \"That can make a big difference.\" The state government spent Rs 2,095 crore as crop insurance premium this year (Rs 1,000 crore less than the target for 2019-20).The government\\'s ability to implement the farm loan waiver will depend on the state\\'s GST collections. This year, even though there is a jump in collections, it has not met targets till December-end. For Chief Minister Thackeray, this will be reason for worry.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Menon     Chennai January 17, 2020 ISSUE DATE: January 27, 2020UPDATED: January 17, 2020 12:00 IST  CONFIDENCE TRICK: DMK leader MK Stalin. (Photo by: Jaison G)If the December 2019 election to rural bodies is any indication, the ass\\xadembly election in 2021 holds uncertain prospects for both the ruling All-India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and its main rival, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). The DMK-led front, which won 38 of Tamil Nadu\\'s 39 Lok Sabha seats in 2019, retained its lead with a higher tally of wards in panchayat unions and district panchayats, but only just about.These are the first local body elections after the deaths of AIADMK and DMK titans J. Jayalalithaa and M. Karunanidhi, respectively. The DMK and its allies won 243 of the 513 district panchayat wards and bagged 2,099 seats in the panchayat union wards while the AIADMK won 214 district panchayat wards and 1,781 panchayat union seats. The BJP won seven district panchayat wards and 85 panchayat union wards.Around 77 per cent voters (nearly 20 million people) voted in 27 of Tamil Nadu\\'s 36 districts to elect representatives for village panchayats, panchayat unions and district panchayats. The verdict was near-even, with DMK and AIADMK getting a majority in 13 districts each, and Sivaganga giving both an equal number of seats. The Supreme Court has asked for delimitation of wards in five new districts and wants elections in all nine remaining districts in three months.The AIADMK seems to have regai\\xadned much of the support it lost during the parliamentary polls. The party held on to most of its traditional strongholds and retained the western zone, except the Nilgiris and Krishnagiri areas. Opp\\xadosition to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act may have influenced voters against the AIADMK. The DMK strengthened its position in the central region, making inroads even in Salem district, an AIADMK bastion, while holding on to its Tiruchirapalli, Tiruvarur and Thiruvannamalai bases.In response to state law minister D. Jayakumar dismissing his party as a waning moon, DMK president M.K. Stalin said, \"Our strength in the assembly has increased from 89 to 100. We had just 30 district panchayat councillors in 2011; now we have 243. I leave it to you to decide whether we are waning or waxing.\"But beyond the rhetoric, what does the outcome mean for the two parties? \"It exp\\xadoses the AIADMK\\'s declining rural base and the inability of the DMK leadership to translate the people\\'s discontent in its favour,\" says Ramu Manivannan, head of the department of politics and public administration, University of Madras. Both parties need to make course corrections and be wary of dark horses Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan. The filmstars-turned-politicians are looking to capitalise on the churn, counting specially on younger voters disillusioned by the two big Dravidian parties.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

(Photo: Getty Images)Union minister of state for environment, forests and climate change Babul Supriyo has been making news in West Bengal. Sources say Union home minister Amit Shah has singled out Supriyo to lead the party\\'s pro-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) campaign in the state. A BJP leader says, \"We need to project that we will push aggressively for the CAA. Who better to do it than Babul, who is fluent in Hindi and Bengali and has star appeal?\" Shah is also reportedly convinced that Supriyo\\'s aggression will be useful in countering anti-CAA sentiment.Supriyo\\'s aggression was on display in late December 2019. After a student graduating from Jadavpur University protested the CAA by tearing up a page from it at her convocation, Supriyo criticised her online, and was, in turn, questioned. Responding to a student named Mustafizur Rahman, Supriyo wrote that he would answer Rahman\\'s questions after he had been \\'sent back to his own country\\'. (Just to be clear, Rahman is an Indian Muslim.) However, the BJP\\'s state unit is reportedly sceptical of the plan, given the controversy in Supriyo\\'s wake and the friction between him and state BJP president Dilip Ghosh.15 Number of families BJP leaders are expected to meet every day for its CAA campaignGhosh is himself no stranger to aggression. At a rally in Rana-ghat on January 12, while talking about the destruction of public property in anti-CAA protests, Ghosh lauded the way some BJP state governments had come down on protesters. \"Just look at Assam, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka...our governments there killed those devils with bullets. They were killed like dogs,\" he was reported to have said. Those who damaged public property in West Bengal would be shot \"the same way\", he went on to say. Trying to distance himself and the party from Ghosh\\'s choice outburst, Supriyo tweeted it was a \\'very irresponsible\\' statement and \\'it is a figment of his imagination, BJP governments in UP and Assam have NEVER EVER resorted to shooting\\'. But Ghosh brushed aside the implied rebuke, saying: \"Such differences of opinion are okay in any party.\" Regarding Supriyo being chosen to lead the pro-CAA push, Ghosh notes that this template-an MP from the state serving as coordinator-is being used in other states as well.Other state leaders like to emphasise the BJP\\'s strength lies in its foot soldiers. \"More than 80,000 workshops have been conducted, in which workers have been trained on how to approach households and ensure registration for the CAA,\" says BJP leader Diptiman Sengupta. The party has undertaken a \\'ghar-ghar sampark\\' programme, tasking leaders with meeting between 15 and 40 families per day. Insisting on anonymity, a BJP general secretary from the state said Hindus will be told that the fight is for astitva (belonging), while for Muslims \"the onus will be on them to prove that they are citizens. If they stop us at the gate, it will mean they have something to hide. We have to convince them that holding back from registration would be disastrous because they would lose out on the benefit of public schemes. Even migration to other parts of the country for jobs will be difficult\".Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

(Photo: Mujeen Faruqui)As Chief Minister Kamal Nath undertakes his annual pilgrimage to the World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting at Davos from January 20, the big challenge before him will be to get business for the state. While Madhya Pradesh is primarily an agrarian state, there is now a fairly broad-based consensus that the state must outgrow its dependence on agriculture and build capabilities in manufacturing and services. Nath has been trying to drive that change since he took over in December 2018, and policy changes and legislative support have begun to slowly make a difference. Early on, his government saw the need to ease land acquisition and building laws. Circle rates were slashed by 20 per cent, and the number of documents required to get building permissions and layouts, from 27 to five. \"Colonisers can begin work and don\\'t need permission. We will check for compliances after three years,\" said Nath at Magnificent Madhya Pradesh, the state\\'s business meet in October 2019.In the post-GST era, MP has a strategic locational advantage. \"MP shares its borders with five states...a population of nearly 500 million can be acc\\xadessed from here,\" says state chief secretary S.R. Mohanty. Under a separate policy for warehousing and logistics, the state is offering investment assistance of up to Rs 15 crore on plant and machinery, stamp duty exemption and an increased floor area ratio (FAR). Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is setting up its nat\\xadional distribution centres here. \"Reliance will use 10 million sq. ft of space at 45 locations,\" RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani announced at the Magnificent MP event. \"Walmart, Reliance and Amazon too have expressed interest in building logistic hubs and warehouses in the state,\" says Rajesh Rajora, principal secretary, in the department of industrial policy and investment promotion.The state has also tweaked its industrial pro\\xadmotion policy. Prominent amendments include enhancing the investment promotion assistance cap from Rs 150 crore to Rs 200 crore, and an incentive of up to Rs 1 crore, or 50 per cent of the cost, to set up waste management, pollution, safety and water conservation equipment at plants.64 large units set up in past year; rs 7,188 crore aggregate investment; 22,000 jobs createdSince employment-intensive sectors are a focus, tourism has been singled out for support. A capital investment subsidy of 15-30 per cent has been introduced for tourism projects, and a 40 per cent subsidy for ropeways and inaccessible tourist and forest areas. Efforts are also on to enhance the carrying capacity of tiger reserves to capitalise on tiger tourism in the state.The state government has come up with a land pooling pol\\xadicy where landowners willingly give up their small parcels of land for the greater economies of scale. An MP Time Bound Clearances Bill has been passed for business applications. A similar law is on the cards for the services sector.According to data put out by the Madhya Pradesh Industries Development Corporation, 64 large-scale industrial units-with aggregate investments of Rs 7,188 crore-have been set up/ exp\\xadanded operations in the state in the past year, creating over 22,000 jobs. Additionally, 545 investment proposals worth Rs 31,425 crore have been cleared through the single window sys\\xadtem.Initial successes notwithsta\\xadn\\xadding, challenges remain. The notorious bureaucracy in the state, general economic sentiment and a stuttering agriculture sector top the list. An excessive monsoon took a toll on crops, and suppre\\xadssed export prices of premium products such as basmati paddy hit farm incomes. The state\\'s financial condition is also cause for concern. It will take two years for the changes Nath has made to take effect, say analysts.

Bihar CM Nitish Kumar. (Photo: ANI)Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has finally come out and said \"there is no question of implementing the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Bihar\". After supporting the passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019 in Parliament, Nitish now says he is open to a debate on the controversial religion-based citizenship law.The chief minister, in a statement in the assembly on January 13, said, \"I have no objection to a detailed debate on the CAA. If the people want it, we can have a discussion in the house. As for the NRC, there is no justification for it.\" He also said the NRC was envisaged in the context of Ass\\xadam, and not the entire country. With this, the JD(U) becomes the third BJP ally-they share power in Bihar-to opp\\xadose the NRC, which many believe is next on the party agenda after the CAA and the National Population Register (NPR).This comes as bad news for the BJP. On January 16, Union home minister and party president Amit Shah is to address a public meeting in Bihar\\'s Vaishali district to drum up support for the contentious citizenship law. The state is set for the assembly election in November this year, so Kumar\\'s remark assumes crucial significance. By calling for a discussion on the CAA, he has not just expressed a need for a rethink, he has , in fact, questioned the justification for the new citizenship law. His latest statements are also seen as an attempt to harmonise the conflicting stands taken inside the JD(U) itself. Two prominent leaders, Pavan K. Varma and Prashant Kishor, who openly opposed the CAA and NRC, were heckled by other leaders.\"I have complete faith in Nitishji\\'s secular credentials and I totally believe that he cannot support any religiously exclusive citizenship law,\" Varma had said then. He made a fresh pitch after BJP leader and Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi recently announced the dates for collection of data for the NPR. JD(U) insiders say Varma has overlooked the Bihar government\\'s December 18 notification for the NPR exercise in the state. The notification was published in a gazette on January 3. Poll strategist Kishor, who has also been vocal in his opposition to the CAA and the NRC, had called on Kumar last month to discuss the issue.Nitish\\'s ambivalence on CAA will embarrass ally BJP, but it is a calculated gamble in an election yearJD(U) spokesperson K.C. Tyagi, meanwhile, says the NPR must not be confused with the NRC. \"NPR was introduced during the UPA regime. Now that the prime minister has clarified that there will be no NRC, there is no problem going ahead with the NPR,\" he said.The NPR is a register of the country\\'s \\'usual residents\\'. The rules make it mandatory for every resident to register for this. The new population register has triggered a controversy as it will include questions on date and place of birth of parents, as also their last place of residence. While clarifying his party\\'s (new) stand on the CAA-NRC, Kumar also made a case for releasing caste data collected in the Census exercise. He has long been insisting that the Centre release this data, arguing that without it, various castes give their own statistics and claim under-representation in government. The demand is also a ploy to win over formidable vote banks in an election year.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

While questions are being raised about the crumbling infrastructure, staff shortage and poor hygiene at Jay Kay Lon-pigs were found roaming inside the premises-by all accounts, this had been a tragedy waiting to happen.The death toll of 100 in December-the hospital\\'s worst for the month in the past five years-consists of mostly underweight newborns, many of whom were referred here from other maternity and non-specialised medical centres. In 2019, the average mortality rate at Jay Kay Lon was 5.6 per cent of the total admissions and 19 per cent of the admissions in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). For the record, infant fatalities at the hospital have been the lowest in 2019, if figures for the past five years are taken into account.Paediatricians at Jay Kay Lon often say \"jugaad (stop-gap)\" is the order of the day. They say, so poor is the hospital\\'s layout it offers little sunlight-so essential for newborns. The NICU, set up in 2011-12, does not follow prescribed norms, such as an oxygen pipeline and air-conditioning to maintain temperatures at 27-30 degrees Celsius. In winters, newborns are kept comfortable with warmers and room heaters.In 2012, the Gehlot government had sanctioned 60 beds for children and 60 for gynaecology, but the subsequent BJP government allowed only 45 in gynaecology. Both governments have failed to build a new wing here under the Mother and Child Hospital scheme of the central government. Little surprise then that the hospital\\'s NICU and emergency neonatal ward, which have sanctioned bed strengths of 42 and 21 respectively, pack in two, three and even four babies per bed, and nurses cater to many more babies than the standard protocol recommends.Following the hue and cry after the current spate of deaths, the Gehlot government on January 2 ordered the setting up of a 12-bed NICU which is expected to be ready within three months. Much of the medical equipment that had broken down, including warmers, infusion pumps and ventilators, has been repaired or replaced. Eighty per cent of the senior doctor posts in paediatrics are vacant. While there is no word on when this shortfall will be bridged, the government has now appointed a senior professor, four assistant professors and 27 nurses. They are expected to join duty within six months. \"While these measures will improve the quality of treatment by reducing the stress on doctors, any significant improvement in the mortality rate in the NICU or the hospital overall is unlikely,\" says Vijay Kumar Sardana, principal, Government Medical College, Kota, to which Jay Kay Lon is attached. Sardana says he is confident that every baby that died here had been given the required care. A significant improvement in mortality rate here is only possible if the Gehlot government quickly approves the proposal for a new wing with air-conditioned NICUs.Gehlot has called the deaths unfortunate, but not unusual. On his request, the Union health ministry has sent a team of experts to Rajasthan to study how the neonatal care infrastructure at Jay Kay Lon can be revamped, including the speedy transportation of critical babies to big hospitals.Gehlot says his government\\'s plan to add 18 government medical colleges and upgrade district hospitals for the purpose will vastly improve access to medicare in the next few years. Gehlot described the chorus of condemnation from the BJP, including from Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla, who represents the Kota constituency, as a tactic to divert attention from the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the economic slowdown.Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot, however, has called his government\\'s response insensitive and demanded accountability. \"People elected us because the BJP governed the state poorly. After being a year in power, we cannot blame the BJP,\" he said, inviting a rebuke from health minister Raghu Sharma. \"I take the blame for every hospital death, but what about Pilot\\'s public works department-which is entrusted with the maintenance of hospitals-taking months to repair leaking ceilings and broken windows there?\" he asked. Clearly, Gehlot is not only battling a healthcare emergency in Kota but malcontent in his own cabinet.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Menon     January 10, 2020 ISSUE DATE: January 20, 2020UPDATED: January 10, 2020 15:48 IST  Tri-junction: CM Jagan Reddy (Photo: Vikram Sharma)Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy appears determined to dash the development plans of his predecessor, N. Chandrababu Naidu. Reddy is preparing to disperse the state capital to three locations-Amaravati, Visakhapatnam and Kurnool.In a report submitted to the chief minister on December 20, 2019, an expert committee headed by retired bureaucrat G. Nageswara Rao had recommended that the state administration be shifted to Visakhapatnam, while the state legislature remains in Amaravati and the high court shifts to Kurnool. Soon after, on January 3, the state government-appointed Boston Consulting Group (BCG) presented its report, which largely agreed with the Rao committee report, recommending decentralised development for the state. Highlighting the economic risk of developing a new capital-through an analysis of 30 greenfield capitals across the globe-the BCG report also noted that aside from Shenzhen and Navi Mumbai, all others had failed to achieve their development targets. As a next step, Chief Minister Reddy has tasked a 16-member committee headed by state finance minister Buggana Rajendranath to study the two reports and present the findings to the legislative assembly before the end of January.However, ex-CM Naidu has rubbished the plan, calling the reports \"waste paper for the Bhogi bonfire rituals ahead of Sankranti\". A lot is at stake for Naidu, who spent much political capital selling the idea of Amaravati as a dream city. Not everyone agreed with that vision, with many suspecting the new city would also serve as a mega real estate venture to benefit the Kamma caste, the dominant group in Naidu\\'s Telugu Desam Party (TDP). Extensive land purchases in and around Amaravati by the Kamma community and other TDP leaders have reinforced this impression and led to allegations of \\'insider trading\\'. While nothing has been proved, a cabinet sub-committee looking into the matter alleged large land purchases by elected representatives, people close to Naidu and by companies in which he owned shares in the period leading up to Amaravati being declared the capital in December 2014. Though Naidu has dismissed these as baseless, CM Reddy is likely to order a probe.However, the TDP is not alone in its opposition. Investors in Amaravati are reportedly apprehensive of poorer-than-expected returns, and farmers who had consented to the land-pooling agreement by which Amaravati\\'s lands were acquired are restive. Even the BJP is against the plan: \"The central government, farmers and bond-holders are also stakeholders [in this matter],\" says state BJP president Kanna Lakshmi Narayana. \"Farmers gave 33,000 acres [under the land-pooling agreement] and the Centre has spent Rs 2,500 crore for the development of Amaravati.\"But CM Reddy appears confident of his three-city plan. Arguing for decentralised development, he says, \"We believe that [development] will be just only if water, funds and administration are equally available to all.\"Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Thackeray has lost direct control over 70 per cent of the state budget and conceded most big-ticket portfolios (including home and finance) in the first expansion of the cabinet on January 5. Only two big departments, urban development and agriculture, are with the Shiv Sena.Political analyst Hemant Desai says NCP chief Sharad Pawar\\'s stamp is all over the government. \"It\\'s obvious that Thackeray has had to compromise,\" he says. Thackeray\\'s close confidant Anil Parab, the minister for legislative affairs, admits that \"you can\\'t always have an advantage in a coalition\" but maintains their \"tuning is fine\".A Sena strategist says the party is looking to broaden its base in rural areas, especially in Vidarbha and western Maharashtra. The agriculture department is with the Sena and a good run for the rural economy could give the party a boost. But that\\'s easier said than done. His two big announcements-loan waivers to farmers and the Shiv Bhojan Rs 10 meal for the poor scheme-will most likely see the allies stealing his thunder. The loan waiver scheme will be implemented jointly by the finance and cooperatives departments headed by the NCP\\'s Ajit Pawar and Balasaheb Patil, respectively. With most co-op banks under NCP control, the party is likely to use the loan waiver amount to strengthen the finances of the banks. \\'Shiv Bhojan\\' falls under the food and civil supplies department, again hea\\xadded by NCP\\'s Chhagan Bhujbal.Thackeray managed to hold on to the agriculture department despite pressure from the Congress. Political observers believe this could result in a bigger mess as agriculture minister Dadaji Bhuse is a relative newbie to the field. Farmer leaders Vijay Jawandhiya and Ajit Navale have already upped the ante accusing the new government of apathy over the plight of flood-affected farmers. At least 300 farmers have committed suicide since November 28, when Thackeray assumed office.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

This will make the state more traveller-friendly,\" he says. The government is also in discussions with petrol pump owners across the state to open toilets at the pumps to all travellers. It\\'s also a bid to boost tourism numbers as the state hopes clean, hygienic public toilets will give it \"better branding\". The state estimates the total cost at Rs 40 crore, with an additional Rs 4 crore a year to maintain the facilities.\\'God\\'s own country\\' attracts over 15 million domestic tourists and one million foreign ones a year with the industry recording around 7 per cent growth in the state year on year despite two consecutive floods and the Nipah virus scare. \"It\\'s a welcome sign, and long overdue. I feel Kerala should design a unique eco-sanitation model, public washrooms with minimum running costs,\" says renowned architect Prof. Eugene Pandala.Predictably, CM Vijayan\\'s critics have accused him of riding on the coat-tails of the Swachh Bharat Mission. Government sources agree that \"one component\" of the funds will come from the unused Swachh funds, but insist the new project is unique. Not everyone is convinced, state Congress chief Mullappally Ramachandran feels this \"Modi-style governance\" isn\\'t the right way forward. \"Before building all these toilets, the CM should perhaps ensure quality ration food material for the poor,\" he says.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Roy's ministerial stint in the Das government was marked by controversy as he raked up alleged corruption and questioned decisions. Denied a ticket by the BJP, he contested the poll as an Independent. Excerpts from an interview:Q. You are a giant-slayer who proved to be the nemesis of Raghubar Das and three previous chief ministers.Whatever I have done is for a cause. I have no personal animosity towards any leader I've exposed. Individuals, irrespective of their positions, do not matter. I believe that the cause, the enormity of the issue, should be the driver.Q. Did you alert the BJP central leadership about the alleged irregularities happening during the time Raghubar Das was in power?Besides registering my dissent during cabinet meetings, I raised corruption issues within the BJP and even spoke to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2017. The PM advised me to share my concerns with the party. I met BJP chief Amit Shah, who promised to improve things in Jharkhand. Things improved temporarily. With 16 departments under his control, Das operated in a highly centralised manner. The BJP leadership erred in trusting him too much.Q. Why do you think Raghubar Das lost the election to you?Not only were people disillusioned by him, even BJP workers were demoralised because of Das's arr\\xadogance. The voters of Jamshedpur East backed me as I inspired trust.Q. What is your opinion about Chief Minister Hemant Soren?I have known him since childhood; I shared a warm personal relationship with his father Shibu Soren. We struck a rapport when Nitish Kumar was sworn in as Bihar chief minister for a brief span in 2000 and Shibu Soren agreed to back him. Hemant is a young politician with a kind heart and commitment to improve things in Jharkhand. He has the opportunity to do so now.Q. As an independent MLA, what's your agenda?I will not join any party or government. I will be a watchdog, keeping a close eye on the new government's work. I will continue to work against corruption. I'll also continue to expose the irregularities during Das's regime.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Shivakumar\\'s constituency, Kan\\xadakapura, has triggered a row in Karnataka. The 10 acres allotted to the Harobele Kapala Betta Development Trust in 2016 \\'for religious purposes\\', have become the site of a controversy between the leaders of the Christian and Hindu communities. Originally ear\\xadma\\xadrked as a gomala (grasslands for cattle grazing), the BJP now says it cannot be transferred to any trust for religious purposes. The party\\'s government in the state has ordered a probe.It all began when Shivakumar attended an event on December 25 to mark the commencement of work on the statue. \"I have visited the site several times,\" he says. \"All necessary due diligence was done before handing over the land to the trust. Christians have been praying on the hilltop for decades. They refer to Kapala Betta as Jesus Cross Hill. These developments are unfortunate.\"Revenue minister R. Ashoka has flayed the \\'illegal\\' construction of the statue. \"They (the trust) have laid a road to the site without approvals. Electricity to the site has been supplied without permission. A probe has been ordered into the matter. We will initiate action based on the findings,\" he says.The BJP has received support from various Hindu organisations and seers. Rishikumara Swami, the pontiff of Kali Mutt, says the name Kapala Betta refers to Lord Shiva and that the hill was used by Hindu saints for meditation. \"We will launch a massive protest if the government allows the trust to build the statue,\" he warns.Political analysts says the issue is more political than religi\\xadous. \"This is typical of the BJP-trying to find a foothold by raking up sensitive issues,\" says political historian A. Veerappa. \"Both the Idgah Maidan row in Hubballi and the Datta Peeta controversy in Bababudangiri Hills helped the BJP expand its base in Karnataka. Now they are trying to make inroads into south Karnataka.\" The BJP has often considered south Karnataka their last frontier in the state. \"Kapala Betta is their opportunity,\" says Veerappa.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Who will be left standing on February 11?advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Gulam Jeelani    January 10, 2020 ISSUE DATE: January 20, 2020UPDATED: January 10, 2020 15:42 IST  Catch them young: CM Arvind Kejriwal at a mega PTA event in a government school in Delhi, January 4 (Photo: Sonu Mehta/Getty Images)On December 24, while releasing a \\'report card\\' of the work done by his Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in the past five years, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said his was the \"most honest\" government in the country. \"I can say with assurance that post-Independence, this has been the most honest government in the country. There were all sorts of agencies probing us, but we got a clean chit from all of them,\" says Kejriwal.Delhi goes to polls on February 8; counting of votes for the 70-member assembly will be done on February 11. The Kejriwal-led AAP is seeking re-election after securing a thumping majority in 2015, winning 67 of the 70 seats. As the polls draw near, AAP is relying on its \"work\" and the BJP on PM Narendra Modi\\'s \"popularity\" to see them through. The Congress, which had ruled Delhi for 15 years before AAP, is hoping for a resurgence, especially after the results in Maharashtra and Jharkhand.After the drubbing in the 2019 general election (the BJP won all seven Lok Sabha seats in the capital), AAP started work on the assembly poll with a massive propaganda outreach on the work it has done. Kejriwal also announced sops, including free rides for women in DTC buses, free electricity up to 200 units, free WiFi, to name a few. \"National issues are important in Lok Sabha elections, but assembly polls are won on local issues. We will repeat 2015 in 2020,\" says Sanjay Singh, Rajya Sabha MP and AAP in-charge for the Delhi polls.There has been a big change in Kejriwal\\'s public posture too. Once a vociferous critic of PM Modi, Kejriwal is not indulging in any Modi- or Centre-bashing in this campaign. Analysts say he doesn\\'t want to be pigeonholed as just a Modi-baiter, more so because studies seem to indicate that Delhi voters too vote differently in national and local elections.A Lokniti-CSDS post-poll survey after the May 2019 Lok Sabha election revealed that 24 per cent of those who voted for the BJP said they might switch to AAP in the assembly election. \"I see it as a direct contest between the AAP and BJP, with the former having an edge,\" says Sanjay Kumar, director, Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS).Unlike 2015, Kejriwal is also assisted in the campaign this time around by poll strategist Prashant Kishor and his Indian Political Action Committee (IPAC). AAP leaders says Kejriwal\\'s makeover was one of Kishor\\'s big tasks.For the BJP, winning Delhi is more than just a prestige issue (given its recent sub-par performances). The party has not been in power here for over two decades. Also, the polls will serve as feedback on the contentious CAA and NRC. No wonder the party is pulling out all the stops with its president and Union home minister Amit Shah going door-to-door in the capital.\"PM Modi\\'s leadership is well known in the country. We will fight the election with full strength,\" Union minister Prakash Javadekar, the BJP\\'s Delhi in-charge, told reporters on January 6.The party\\'s Delhi unit chief Manoj Tiwari is also confident. \"The people of Delhi are fed up with AAP\\'s blame-game politics,\" says Tiwari, now the North East Delhi MP.The Congress faces an uphill task, especially after the demise of three-time CM, Sheila Dikshit. The party failed to win a seat in the two previous parliamentary polls and drew a blank in the 2015 assembly election too.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Thackeray was speaking during the state legislature session in Nagpur. Later, he even said that his party, the Shiv Sena, had made a grave mistake in the past by mixing Hindutva with politics.While the remark is a major departure from the Sena’s hardcore Hindutva politics, political analysts see it as Thackeray’s attempt to signal that the Sena and its coalition partners, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress, have put their ideological differences aside and found a common wavelength for their Maha Vikas Aghadi’ government in the state. It only helped that NCP president Sharad Pawar welcomed the chief minister’s comments, saying that the state government appeared to be on the right track.More proof of deft coalition manoeuvring by Thackeray was evident at his first cabinet expansion on December 30. Not only did the NCP bag most of the prominent portfolios, such as home, finance, public works, excise, housing and labour, Thackeray even agreed to the ally’s demand to induct Sharad Pawar’s powerful nephew Ajit Pawar as his deputy. It was Ajit’s attempt to wean away NCP MLAs and prop up a Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP government that had precipitated the political crisis in Maharashtra in November until Sharad Pawar stepped in to nip the rebellion in his party in the bud and ensure the formation of the Sena-NCP-Congress government.The Shiv Sena got only two important portfolios industry and urban development, which gives it authority to control the civic bodies in urban areas whereas plum departments like revenue, power and school education went to the Congress. Underpinning his secular credentials, Thackeray is the first state chief minister to induct four Muslims into the cabinet Hasan Mushrif, Nawab Malik, Aslam Shaikh and Abdul Sattar.In his month-long stint at the helm so far, Thackeray has made it a point not to antagonise his allies. Toeing their line without adequate homework he announced a loan waiver for farmers on December 21. A week later, though, it became clear that Thackeray’s scheme came with a rider: only farmers with a collective debt of up to Rs 2 lakh would be eligible. Also, the outstanding loan and interest should be for the period July 1, 2015 to September 30, 2019. In case the loan amount is restructured before March 31, 2020, the new amount needs to be under Rs 2 lakh to be eligible.An earlier scheme, implemented by the previous BJP-Sena government, provisioned for a waiver of up to Rs 1.5 lakh irrespective of the outstanding loan amount. Maharashtra BJP president Chandrakant Patil says that the new scheme won’t benefit too many farmers as loans between 2001 and 2016 had already been waived. Farmer leader Vijay Jawandhia said that Thackeray had promised a blanket loan waiver only to do a U-turn.Thackeray could not give details of the estimated number of beneficiaries of his scheme. We have kept our word on making farmers debt-free, he merely said. Finance minister Jayant Patil, however, claims the new scheme will be bigger than the Rs 34,000 crore waiver implemented by the Fadnavis government.Thackeray has also accepted the Congress-NCP’s demand to remove political representatives from cooperative bodies, such as sugar mills and Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMC), mostly controlled by the Congress and the NCP. The chief minister also conceded to the demand to discard the multiple ward representatives system in municipal corporations and restored the one ward, one representative system.Thackeray says the three allies have accepted each other. I am delighted to see workers of all three parties comfortably mingling with each other, he told India Today at an informal interaction. That shows our government will last its full term.Fadnavis, who is leader of the opposition in the state assembly, however, disagrees. He says the auto-rickshaw government will collapse under its own weight within a year and accuses the government of cheating farmers. Those affected by unseasonal rains in October have been completely left out [of the loan waiver], says Fadnavis.Another BJP leader, however, predicts that the government will complete its five years. Power has given the Congress and NCP a new lease of life in Maharashtra and they would be desperate for the government to continue, he feels. Uddhavji might be able to save the government, but not his core voters in the future.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

The Congress, which had won just four of the 10 municipal corporations in 2014, is set to control nine now, perhaps even bagging the tenth if behind-the-scenes negotiations work out.Ten municipal corporations, 38 municipalities and 103 nagar panchayats went to the polls on December 21. The last three polls to ULBs were held through the direct format, with the electorate voting for corporators and the head of the urban body (mayors in municipal corporations and chairpersons of municipalities and nagar panchayats) directly.The state gov\\xad\\xadernment had amended the Chhattisgarh Municipal Corporation Act, 1956 and the Chhattisgarh Municipalities Act, 1961 in October 2019, the result of which was that heads of ULBs were now to be elected by corporators. Elections were held to choose corporators only.The decision was criti\\xadci\\xadsed by the BJP, which felt that indirect elections would promote horse trading and corporators being swayed by the ruling party. The decision was also opposed by the bureaucracy. In indirect elections, the mayor or chairperson is at the mercy of corporators, who could threaten them with withdrawal of supp\\xadort. Also, it slows down the process of decision-making, says a senior civil servant in Chhattisgarh.In the 10 municipal corp\\xado\\xadra\\xadtions that went to the polls, the Congress won an absolute majority in Ambikapur, Chirmiri and Jagdalpur; won half the wards in Bilaspur, Raigarh and Durg; and was the single-largest party in the Raipur, Dhamtari and Rajnandgaon corporations. In Korba, though, the BJP won more wards, but fell short of a majority on its own.The Congress is not acknowledging the role of indirect elections in its victory. It is a result of the work done by the Baghel government...it’s also a rejection of the politics of the BJP, says Shailesh N. Trivedi, state Congress spokesperson.BJP state chief Vikram Usendi, however, said a clear majority for the Congress in only three corporations reflects the unpopularity of the Baghel government in its first year itself.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

As per the new rules, framed on December 12, as a corollary to the West Bengal University and College (Administration and Regulation) Act, 2017, V-Cs have to kowtow to the higher education department on all matters of any consequence and some of none at all even academic tours or MoUs with other institutes.The 2017 act had effectively gag\\xadged teachers, preventing them from airing grievances against the state; even speaking to the media was prohibited. Governor Jagdeep Dhankar says education is being held in captivity. Incidentally, the process of getting yesmen as V-Cs began soon after the Trinamool Congress came to power in 2011. The higher education department minimised the role of varsity bodies in selections, vesting supreme power in a three-member panel.Initially, the committee consisted of a nominee each from the UGC and the university decision-making body, besides the chancellor. Problems arose first when the chancellor (the governor, by default) preferred the UGC nominee, overriding the preference of the state for Jadavpur University in 2012. Soon, the government did away with the UGC nominee, and instead had its own rep\\xadresentative. By stalling election for the posts of elected representatives from among staff and students, the nominated’ ex-officio members soon outnumbered the elected posts and became the decisive voice.The rules have turned the universities into extended offices of the government. The new guidelines have been introduced as rules to bypass a debate in the assembly. This is just a deceitful way to rob the universities of their auto\\xadnomy, says Sujan Chakraborty, leader of the Left parties in the assembly.The V-C’s powers are so curtailed he cannot even call meetings of executive bodies. These laws are arbitrary. We do not want our universities to be run either by Bikash Bhawan (state education department HQ) or Raj Bhawan. This is a classic case of [jumping out of the] frying pan [into] fire, says Partha Pratim Biswas, president of the Jadavpur University Teachers Union.The West Bengal College and Uni\\xadv\\xadersity Teachers Association is now planning protests and rallies to canvass public opinion. Education minis\\xadter Partha Chatterjee is unm\\xadoved. The rules have clearly defined responsibilities and jurisdiction, he says.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

The results proved how unwise the decision was. Though its three-seat haul had left the JVM in a position of no leverage, Soren nevertheless made it a point to meet Marandi and seek advice’. The gesture floored Marandi, who declared unconditional support’ to the new government.Next, Soren withdrew a case under the SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act that he had lodged against former chief minister and rival Raghubar Das of the BJP. Soren had filed a complaint on December 19 over an objectionable comment made by Das.Soren appears to have opted for a more conciliatory approach in his new innings, unlike his first stint as state chief minister from July 2013 to December 2014, when many considered him headstrong. Despite his government’s wafer-thin majority, he had fired three ministers from his cabinet.For the Lok Sabha election, he settled for fewer seats for the JMM and let the Congress lead the alliance. In return, he was assured of the party’s support for the assembly contest.In the first cabinet meeting held hours after Soren took oath as chief minister on December 29, the government decided to withdraw criminal cases lodged against thousands of people who had agitated against the previous BJP government’s proposed amendments to tenancy laws. Most of the cases were filed in 2017. Although the Das government had claimed that the proposed amendments to the Chota Nagpur Tenancy Act and the Santhal Parganas Tenancy Act were meant to plug loopholes in age-old laws, they were seen as a ploy to dilute tribal control over land. Tribal ire proved to be one of the major reasons for the BJP’s defeat in the election.The Soren government has also decided to drop sedition charges slapped on several tribal activists of the Pathalgadi movement, which had rocked the state’s Khunti district, adjoining Ranchi, and its bordering areas and turned violent in 2017-2018.The two decisions will likely reassure the state’s tribal community which makes up 26.3 per cent of the electorate and is the JMM’s core base as well as send a signal that the Soren government does not intend to be confrontational or vindictive. The chief minister, however, made it clear to India Today that those facing corruption charges will not be let off the hook (see interview).The Jharkhand result has come as a morale-booster for the opposition after the BJP-AJSU Party tie-up swept the state in the Lok Sabha poll, winning 12 of the 14 seats. Soren played a key role in keeping the opposition alliance intact and seized the opportunity when the BJP and AJSU Party parted ways before the assembly election. At Soren’s swearing-in, the presence of a galaxy of opposition leaders, who joined hands in a show of strength, suggests that the Jharkhand victory may have provided the opposition more than a reason to stay united at the national level.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Take Tul Palav, an online apparel brand known for fine Kashmiri garments. Before the government pulled the plug on internet services on August 4 in the run-up to the abrogation of Article 370, the company was on tight deadlines ahead of Eid. The current internet shutdown has been the longest, surpassing the previous 133 days when Hizbul commander Burhan Wani was killed in July 2016.Today, brand owner Iqra Ahmed is struggling to keep the company afloat. From the 30 big orders every month, the past four months saw only five orders on their social media page, says the 27-year-old. \"I could not update samples of the new collection. Also, I could not communicate with my workers or family in the initial months when mobile phones were also not working,\" she says. \"My workers from outside J&K left.\"Till August 4, the Instagram page of Tul Palav (nearly 50,000 followers) was full of photos of \\'traditional wear with modern cuts\\', including pherans, which are popular in winter among the diaspora as well. The venture used to get more than 10 orders a month from clients in the US and West Asia on Instagram alone.Many entrepreneurs shifted to Delhi to keep ventures running but that is not helping either. Kashmir Box, a well-known online start-up known for selling products ranging from traditional Kashmir produce to handicrafts, has 30 staffers at its office in Srinagar\\'s Nawab Bazar. But the Valley\\'s first e-commerce firm, which at one point was delivering products to almost 30 countries, shows no sign of life now. \"The internet was our life-blood, we can\\'t sustain ourselves without it,\" says an employee. The company has an office in Delhi, but it is impossible to run operations from there as products have to come from Kashmir.In the Gupkar Road neighbourhood in Srinagar, entrepreneur Saqib Mir is sitting in his rented office on a rainy December afternoon. The 32-year-old\\'s food venture, \\'Kolahai Waters\\', launched in 2014, had quickly become a success. He had 300-odd staffers at one point but everything has stalled now. \"We had an online service providing all material for marriages at one place,\" says Mir. Burdened with Rs 70 lakh in bank loans, he has decided to wind up operations.A Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) report has compiled losses from August 5 till December 3. It puts the losses at Rs 17,878 crore and almost 500,000 job cuts. KCCI president Sheikh Ashiq says the apprehension now is a surge in bank NPAs, with most young entrepreneurs on the verge of collapse. The Jammu and Kashmir Bank, the primary lender in the region, has recommended a moratorium on loans due to the shutdown, but there is no clarity about it yet. \"Both bank and private borrowings are piling up. Entrepreneurs had got soft loans in the past, but they are all collapsing now,\" says Sheikh.The state government had rolled out a J&K Start-up Policy in 2018 to nurture 500 start-ups in a decade. The J&K Entrepreneurship Development Institute was key in this, providing soft loans under different schemes. Established in the late 1990s, it has trained over 29,000 youth and helped set up close to 14,500 ventures in food processing, floriculture, textiles, apparel, horticulture, poultry farms etc.Institute director Tufail Mattoo admits entrepreneurs have been affected, but calls it a \"temporary phase\". \"They will get over it. During monthly reviews, we have learnt that things are picking up again. Also, we have provided net facility here,\" he says.A bitter Saqib Mir says it\\'s all just a front to get publicity. \"They set us up to see us collapse. Only an idiot will invest here now,\" he says.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

The chief minister recently returned from a 10-day tour of Japan and South Korea where the state explored technological and economic cooperation and sought investment in industries, tourism and fisheries. Investments to the tune of Rs 300 crore came through during the visit, Pinarayi informed the media on his return. He said while Japan\\'s Nitta Gelatin Inc. has promised an investment of Rs 200 crore to manufacture gelatin for pharmaceuticals and food applications, Terumo Corp., another Japanese firm, will put in Rs 105 crore to manufacture blood bags. Both companies already have investments in Kerala.Pinarayi\\'s latest tour had come amid allegations by the opposition that his international travels were \"pleasure trips with family\" that were bleeding the exchequer. \"It\\'s a clear case of extravaganza at a time the state is reeling under a financial crisis. Pinarayi Vijayan has driven the state to peril,\" alleged Mullappally Ramachandran, chief of the state Congress Committee.Pinarayi defends his foreign travels, saying: \"My tours are for the youth of Kerala. We need mega investments to fast-track development.\" According to a senior bureaucrat who was part of the delegation to Japan and Korea, \"The chief minister had a hectic schedule. He showcased Kerala before investors and sought their cooperation. This is the first time a Kerala chief minister is making efforts to market the state to global investors.\"Coming to power in May 2016, one of Pinarayi\\'s priorities has been to improve the state\\'s business environment. With Kerala ranked 21st in the state-wise ease of doing business rankings for 2017, he had his work cut out. Pinarayi aimed to turn Kerala into a hub of service and technology in order to create jobs and dispel the investor-phobia typically associated with communist governments. \"In 2018, Pinarayi Vijayan put an end to nokkukooli (gawking fees) charged by trade unions. In Kerala\\'s context, it was not easy,\" says an aide of the chief minister. \"He also streamlined industrial policies. In the past three and a half years, 11 global companies have set up projects in the state.\"The government has also introduced single-window clearances for projects, with an officer of the rank of additional private secretary monitoring proposals and cutting delays in issuing licences to industry. Under K-Swift, the Single Window Interface for Fast & Transparent Clearance, the government has assured clearance to projects within 30 days of applying.In his tenure, Pinarayi has led business delegations to the UAE, US, the Netherlands, Switzerland, France and the UK. The government says the visits attracted foreign investments worth around Rs 1,700 crore-in IT, health, tourism, education, fisheries and manufacturing.\"The Left government has [declared] its performance record every year. We are committed to providing Kerala a new direction,\" says LDF convenor A. Vijayaraghavan.

A comeback?advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Amitabh Srivastava    New Delhi December 23, 2019 ISSUE DATE: December 30, 2019UPDATED: December 25, 2019 16:47 IST  RESCUE ACT: Pappu Yadav and his aides wade through a flooded Patna street with relief material in September (Photo: Sonu Kishan)Crisis is often an opportunity in disguise, and Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav, Bihar’s don-turned-politician and five-term Lok Sabha MP, grabbed one this September when torrential rains lashed Patna.Three days of blinding rains, beginning September 27, had left more than half the city under waist-deep water, displacing thousands of people. As boats criss-crossed streets and Patna resembled a marooned habitation, Yadav emerged on the scene as an unlikely hero. With a hundred-odd volunteers from his Jan Adhikar Party (JAP), he waded through the waterlogged areas for days, distributing food and medicines, and rescuing people.When the flood waters receded, Yadav held a medical camp for the people. That he made these efforts in Patna, where he is thought to have no political base, was surprising. The 51-year-old leader, who served jail term in a murder case before being acquitted in 2013, has won all his Lok Sabha elections from the Kosi region, some 300 km from Patna.Two months on, his hard work seems to be paying off. The JAP, which was launched in 2015, made a splash in the Patna University students’ union election, winning the president’s post. Manish, the victorious candidate, attributed his feat to Yadav’s flood relief.Though the JAP’s success in the university may not be significant in the overall political scene in Bihar, observers feel it is a good start for the fledgling party. Even Lalu Prasad shot into limelight after being elected Patna University students’ union president in 1973. Sushil Kumar Modi became general secretary, says a JAP official.JAP leaders say the victory could not have come at a better time for Yadav, who failed to retain the Madhepura seat in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. His wife Ranjeet Ranjan, the sitting MP from Supaul, too, lost her seat.Patna has long been a BJP bastion. While the party lost the 2015 assembly election to the mahagathbandhan, it won all five assembly segments in Patna. It also controls the city’s municipal corporation. JAP insiders say the party is considering contesting all seats in Patna in the 2020 assembly poll, and Yadav could be in the fray from one of the seats.Yadav sure knows how to keep the pot boiling till then. In October, he drove a garbage-laden tractor to a Bihar minister’s home in Patna and threatened to dump the trash there. More recently, during the onion crisis, he sold onions at concessional rates in front of the BJP office in the city. Observers see these as attempts to pitch himself as the only viable alternative to the BJP in Patna.Yadav’s consuming political ambitions have done him no favours in the past. The RJD suspended him after the 2014 Lok Sabha election, when he was seen to be trying to usurp Lalu’s legacy. The Congress and the JD(U) have slammed the door on him. Even the BJP seems disinterested. All this has landed Yadav in a crisisand maybe presented him an opportunity.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Tare  New Delhi December 23, 2019 ISSUE DATE: December 30, 2019UPDATED: December 25, 2019 16:47 IST  AGREEING TO DISAGREE? Pankaja Munde with former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis (Photo: Getty Images)On December 12, as she addressed a rally of thousands of supporters in her hometown Beed in central Maharashtra, influential BJP leader Pankaja Munde\\'s words had a challenge wrapped in an exhortation. Addressing her constituency of OBC (Other Backward Class) voters, who have been BJP loyalists, she said: \"The BJP has been a bahujan party. Don\\'t allow it to be controlled by a handful [of leaders].\"Munde, 40, did not name anyone, but to many, the apparent target was former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, with whom she has had volatile ties. Like heavyweight OBC leader Eknath Khadse, Munde too feels that 49-year-old Fadnavis, a Brahmin, should take the blame for the BJP\\'s failure to secure a majority on its own in the October assembly election.Munde lost the Parli assembly seat to cousin Dhananjay Munde of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), by 32,000 votes. The defeat was all the more humiliating as she was the only BJP candidate for whom both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah had campaigned. Khadse\\'s daughter Rohini, who replaced him in the Muktainagar seat, lost to independent candidate Chandrakant Patil by about 5,000 votes. \"Someone at the top was responsible for the defeat,\" says Khadse. \"If seniors like me, Vinod Tawde and Prakash Mehta had been involved in the poll campaign, we would have won 25 more seats for the party.\" With 105 seats, the BJP ended up 40 short of a simple majority in the state assembly.Khadse and Munde are members of the BJP\\'s core committee, which takes policy decisions. They have announced a boycott of the committee\\'s meetings till the party fixes responsibility for their defeats. \"Fadnavis was on Dhananjay\\'s side. He sanctioned all financial proposals of the NCP leader,\" says a Munde supporter.Munde has announced a statewide tour with other OBC leaders from January. \"I will not quit. Let the party sack me,\" she says. So far, Munde has the backing of two MLAs-Monika Rajale and Madhuri Misal-Khadse, Mehta and former BJP minister Babanrao Lonikar.Maharashtra\\'s OBCs have been a BJP vote-bank, accounting for almost half its votes. In the 1980s, the BJP\\'s Vasantrao Bhagwat played a key role in bringing three prominent OBC communities-Mali, Dhangar, Vanjari-into the party fold. This election, however, the party suffered the shock defeats of three key OBC leaders-Yogesh Tilekar, Ram Shinde and Munde.The Fadnavis-Munde rivalry surfaced soon after the BJP came to power in Maharashtra in 2014. Munde made her chief ministerial aspirations known and claimed she was the only state BJP leader with a mass following. In 2015, Fadnavis relieved Munde of the water conservation portfolio even as she was attending a conference in Singapore. The same year, however, he backed Munde after she was accused of being involved in an alleged scam.Two prominent OBC leaders, Girish Mahajan and Chandrashekhar Bawankule, have expressed solidarity with Fadnavis, calling him a visionary leader and an outstanding administrator.However, the BJP could have a messy rebellion in its ranks unless the differences between the former chief minister and Pankaja are sorted out.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

With panchayat elections round the corner, political parties have hardened their stands. While Bhupesh Baghel, the state\\'s Congress chief minister, has dubbed the Centre\\'s stand anti-farmer, the local BJP unit, while unable to get the Centre to agree to the payment of bonus, is accusing Baghel of making an insincere promise. \"CM Bhupesh Baghel, when he was in the opposition, had demanded that procurement begin from November 1, but has now extended the date to December 1,\" said BJP Kisan Morcha\\'s Sandeep Sharma.This year, the Union government announced an MSP of Rs 1,815 per quintal for the common variety of paddy andRs 1,835 for the Grade A variety. The Baghel government had announced it would procure paddy at Rs 2,500 per quintal in 2019. This means it will have to pay bonuses at the rate of Rs 685 and Rs 665 per quintal respectively. The Centre has warned that if the state pays this bonus-something that distorts the market price of rice-it will not lift the nearly 3.2 million tonnes of rice the state provides to the central pool. Chhattisgarh will then have to bankroll the entire procurement, which it cannot do on its own.Initially, Baghel announced an agitation in Delhi to compel the Centre to come around, but gave up the idea. Then, a vehicle rally to Delhi was planned, which was also cancelled. \"The Union government had allowed the previous BJP government in the state to pay [an MSP+] bonus to farmers in 2018 and 2017 even though it stopped bonus payments from 2014 onwards. This was done to help the BJP win the assembly election. This smacks of double standards,\" he said.Invoking Chhattisgarhi asmita or pride, the CM says he has said his government will buy paddy at Rs 2,500 even if the Centre does not. He was hailed as a man with a \\'56-inch heart\\' to PM Modi\\'s \\'56-inch chest\\' at a farmers\\' meet, of which there have been several across the state.The Chhattisgarh government began paddy procurement from December 1, almost two weeks behind schedule, even though the Centre has not approved the procurement. The last date for procurement has been extended to mid-February. The state has targeted a procurement of 8.5 million tonnes of paddy this year. About 1.97 million farmers are registered with the state government for selling paddy. Sources in the state government privately say it does not want a full-blown confrontation with the Centre at this point. A five-member cabinet committee has been formed to work towards a resolution.Aware of the burgeoning procurement bill, the state has limited the quantity of paddy a farmer can sell to the government to 15 quintals per acre, even though average production ranges from 20-25 quintals per acre. This means farmers will be unable to sell their entire produce to the government, which is offering the best rates.An extended monsoon in October and November has given the state reason to believe total paddy production will touch 12.5 million tonnes, from 10.5 million tonnes in 2018. Chhattisgarh needs about 3 million tonnes of rice to meet its PDS requirement. It is expected that it will pick up the tab for the PDS rice even if the Centre does not agree to the bonus.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Fourteen years later, on the last day of the winter session, current chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat of the BJP successfully stewarded the Uttarakhand Devasthanam Management Bill through the state assembly. Once this becomes law, the new provisions will allow the state government to take over the management of 51 temples in Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri.The Tiwari regime stopped at setting up the Badrinath Kedarnath Temple Committee (BKTC), which continues to manages these temples. The shrines, which are open only in the summer months, received over 3 million pilgrims and donations worth Rs 12 crore in 2018-19. The numbers had gone down after the 2013 flash floods, but bounced back after the temples reopened.A senior Union cabinet minister in Delhi said the new law would help modernise facilities at the shrines. The BJP-led central government is linking four prominent Hindu pilgrimage sitesBadrinath, Dwarka, Jagannath Puri and Rameshwaramalong with 12 jyotirlingas, including Kedarnath, with highway nodes and railheads.But a big challenge now for the Rawat regime is to douse the anger over the move, and not just of party MLAs and cabinet colleagues but also of various godmen. Along with them, the teerth purohit (pilgrim priests), local businessmen and traders are also up in arms. These people are the traditional vote base of the BJP, says a party MLA. The temple towns have seen heavy snowfall, which will slow down the pace of life in this area, and buy some time for the chief minister. The priests had held a mahapanchayat mid-November to mount pressure on the chief minister to make changes in the law.The opposition Congress is in no mood to make life easy for Rawat. Party state unit chief Pritam Singh joined the protests and even committed that the law will be repealed if the party came to power after the 2022 assembly poll. Utt\\xadarakhand is not a state that favours incumbents, and that fact will worry Rawat too.Rawat, who had won over some the state’s godmen with his announcement of a grand temple for Sita in Pauri district (in Phalswari village, the place where she is said to have taken samadhi) and another grand temple for Raghunath (Rama) in Devaprayag, is suddenly facing the wrath of various senior leaders in the RSS and the VHP. Alok Kumar, working president of the VHP, says they (the protesters) will continue with the struggle but will maintain dialogue (with the establishment). Meanwhile, Baba Ramdev of Patanjali Yogapeeth met with agitating Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad national president Mahant NarendraGiri and extended his support. If the government wants to take over the management of religious places, they must do so of all institutions across religions. They can’t choose only Hindu pilgrimage sites, says Ramdev.The RSS and VHP stand is that the government should have a very limited role in managing religious shrines. The new law runs counter to this principle, says a top RSS leader preferring anonymity. The chief minister, who skipped the assembly when the bill was tabled, says it was hard to get a consensus on the issue. State tourism minister Satpal Maharaj added: We need this legislation to regularise and regulate things in a proper manner.These temples were traditionally managed by the BKTC, with the seniormost local MLA nominated as chairman, and members of local bodies and other prominent people from the region represented on the committee. The new bill will make the chief minister (if he is a Hindu) and the chief secretary members of the new board, with an IAS officer as CEO. The board will work on the lines of the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board and the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD). They will use the funds to improve infrastructure, develop the temple towns, and provide better facilities to people coming for the yatra, says a top state minister who, given the current controversy, also did not want to be named.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Tare  March 13, 2020 ISSUE DATE: March 23, 2020UPDATED: March 13, 2020 13:10 IST  Goodies galore (From right): Ajit Pawar, Uddhav Thackeray and MoS for finance Shambhuraje Desai arrive to present the 2020-21 budget. (Photo: Mandar Deodhar)Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray looked visibly pleased as Deputy Chief Minister and Finance Minister Ajit Pawar presented the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government\\'s first budget on March 6. Four sectors that Thackeray has long supported -- agriculture, urban development, transport and tourism -- have all received significant consideration.The state budget estimates total expenditure at Rs 1.15 lakh crore, of which close to 40 per cent -- about Rs 42,588 crore -- will be spent on social and community services. Another Rs 16,333 crore has been allocated to agriculture and allied services, while the transport department, overseen by the Shiv Sena\\'s Anil Parab, has got Rs 16,846 crore. This is almost Rs 800 crore more than the crucial water resources department, headed by the Nationalist Congress Party\\'s Jayant Patil. The government has also announced a 1 per cent stamp duty concession for two years in urban pockets, including the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Nagpur. This, it is hoped, will go some way in reviving sales in the real estate sector, which is overseen by the Sena\\'s Eknath Shinde. Thackeray\\'s focus on social welfare is evident in two schemes -- loan waiver to farmers (which gets Rs 22,000 crore; Rs 15,000 crore in 2019-20 and Rs 7,000 crore in 2020-21) and the Shiv Bhojan meal at Rs 10. The latter scheme, which has been allocated Rs 150 crore, has been an instant hit since its launch on January 26. The government has now doubled the daily number of plates served to 36,000 from 18,000 across 148 centres in the state and says it plans to increase that number to 100,000 per day. \"The response to this scheme has been overwhelming,\" says food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal.The opposition has derided the \"freebie\" culture inherent in power minister Nitin Raut\\'s plan to provide free electricity up to 100 units to domestic consumers. But he is determined to continue with the AAP government-inspired plan. A committee of three secretaries has been set up to chalk out a proposal.In keeping with the Sena\\'s core bel\\xadiefs, learning Marathi is now compulsory in all boards till Standard 10. \"Syllabus evaluations will be our priority in the future,\" says school education minister Varsha Gaikwad, from the Congress.The environment has always been a big priority of the Thackerays, and the chief minister\\'s son and minister for environment and tourism, Aaditya Thackeray, has big plans. This includes a dedicated \\'Green Fund\\', and promoting free \\'forest walks\\' in areas other than wildlife reserves. \"I am in talks with the forest department to make it a reality,\" says Aaditya. His department will also get Rs 1,000 crore for a world-class aquarium to be constructed in Worli, his constituency. Mumbai also gets an annual Rs 100 crore for the development of tourism infrastructure.Chief Minister Thackeray has reiterated that his government\\'s commitment is to make people\\'s lives comfortable. However, Devendra Fadnavis, leader of the opposition, says Thackeray is leading a \"stay government\" -- a dig at Uddhav\\'s decision to put on hold some projects initiated in Fadnavis\\'s time.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " '\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n Why Mamata Released Chhatradhar | West BengalThe Maoist leader\\'s release, after a decade in jail, is part of the TM C\\'s bid to win back its vote in the tribal belt.advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Romita Datta  New Delhi March 13, 2020 ISSUE DATE: March 23, 2020UPDATED: March 13, 2020 13:10 IST  Man in demand: Chhatradhar Mahato after his release. (Photo: Subir Halder)Chhatradhar Mah\\xadato, once the face of the People\\'s Committee against Police Atrocities (PCPA), an overground outfit of the Maoists in Bengal, was rel\\xade\\xadased on February 1. One of the accused in an abortive attempt to blow up Left Front chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee\\'s convoy in November 2008, he was arr\\xadested In September 2009.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was then leader of the Opposition, and Mahato\\'s release was a const\\xadant chant as the Trinamool Con\\xadgress (TMC) worked with the PCPA in the tribal belt to unseat the Left. But that was then. Mamata has been in power since 2011, but it took her till now to keep her promise.During this time, despite the pleas and intimidatory tactics of the Maoists and even Mahato\\'s wife Niyati\\'s ultimatum to contest from the area on a Samajwadi Party ticket, nothing moved Mamata. Things started changing after the 2018 panchayat poll. The BJP won 42 per cent of the vote in Jhargram and 33 per cent in Purulia in that election. A year later, the Lok Sabha results saw the BJP sweep five (Purulia, Jhargram, Bankura, Bishnupur, Medinipur) of the six Lok Sabha constituencies in this belt, which sent alarm bells ringing in the TMC. In the context of the assembly, this would count for 42 seats.The TMC realised that they needed a tribal face to win back the tribal ST vote (29 per cent), and who better than the legendary Mahato, who was in jail for leading a people\\'s movement against the police and administration. Files started moving to commute Mahato\\'s life term and the government made overtures to ensure the loyalty of the family. His two sons were given government jobs as well.Word has got around that Mahato might join the TMC and that he has thanked Mamata for the development work in the Jangalmahal area (the erstwhile Maoist belt including West Medinipur, Purulia, Bankura and Jhargram). TMC spokesperson and minister Partha Chatterjee has publicly said that Mahato was welcome, though the man himself says he will decide when \"the time is right. As of now, I am trying to get a feel of the situation\".The TMC thinks Mahato could be their saviour, but people on the ground, like Krishna Murmu of the Bharat Jakat Manjhi Pargana Mahal (an outfit of the Santhals), think otherwise. \"The tribals feel Mamata has betrayed them. We elected her hoping for good governance, but she let loose her corrupt leaders on us. We (tribals) got nothing, whereas even hardcore Maoists were rehabilitated with fat comp\\xadensation packages and given jobs,\" he says. BJP state president Dilip Ghosh has weighed in as well, and sees Mahato\\'s release as a TMC conspiracy to unleash the Maoists on his party.So, can Mahato help the TMC? His influence is limited to the Jhargram LS constituency -- seven assembly seats including his hometown Lalgarh. What might work is his tragic hero image -- that of a law-abiding citizen dragged into politics when the Maoists needed an honest face for their front office. Chhatradhar\\'s brother is slain Maoist leader Sasha\\xaddhar, so he was a nat\\xadural choice. Now, after a decade in jail, he is again being pushed into politics, this time because the TMC wants it as the price of his freedom.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " '\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n Congress, Left Make Common Cause | West BengalFrom joint street protests to a consensus Rajya Sabha poll candidate, both sides are working to make their \\'alliance\\' tick.advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Romita Datta  March 13, 2020 ISSUE DATE: March 23, 2020UPDATED: March 13, 2020 13:10 IST  Double Barrel: Protest A Congress-CPI(M) stir in Kolkata on March 1 against Union home minister Amit Shah’s visit. (Photo: Subir Halder)The forthcoming Rajya Sabha election has presented the Congress and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in West Bengal a fresh opportunity to strengthen their state-level \\'alliance\\' against the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the BJP. The two parties, which had been locked in negotiations on a consensus candidate for one of the five Rajya Sabha seats from the state, have agreed on the candidature of CPI(M) nominee and former Kolkata mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya. The other four seats will go to the TMC on the basis of its strength in the state assembly.Initially, the Congress had favoured CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury as the joint candidate, but his party said its norms disallowed members from being nominated for a third Rajya Sabha term. Yechury has been Rajya Sabha MP for consecutive terms between 2005 and 2017. The Left had turned down Yechury\\'s candidature, proposed by the Congress, on two previous occasions as well.Throughout the stalemate, though, state leaders from both sides were determined to make things work. \"If not Yechury, it should be some other mutually agreeable candidate. We cannot allow the TMC to win the fifth vacant [Rajya Sabha] seat,\" a senior Congress leader from Bengal said, requesting anonymity. The leader was referring to 2018 when the Congress had to take the TMC\\'s help to send Abhishek Singhvi to the Rajya Sabha. Apart from Bhattacharya, two other names were floated by the Left for the March 26 Rajya Sabha poll -- former MP Mohammed Salim and retired Supreme Court judge Asok Kumar Ganguly.The 2019 Lok Sabha election rout has seen the Congress and Left join forces in Bengal. In the past 10 months, the two sides have held joint street protests against the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) and the NRC (National Register of Citizens), the withdrawal of Kashmir\\'s special status and the communal violence in Delhi. They have been putting out joint resolutions in the state assembly and even addressing the media side by side. \"We are together and are looking at electoral seat adjustments. The idea is to offer Bengal an alternative to the BJP and the TMC, which are dividing the people for votes,\" says CPI(M) central committee member Robin Deb.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " \"\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n A New DirectionThe Jaganmohan Reddy government makes a push for speedy justice in crimes against women.advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Amarnath K. Menon     Telangana March 6, 2020 ISSUE DATE: March 16, 2020UPDATED: March 6, 2020 11:24 IST  Jaganmohan ReddyOn February 24, Chittoor’s first additional district judge, M. Venkata Harinath, awarded the death sentence to Mohammed Rafi, 27, for the rape and murder of a five-year-old girl at Angallu village, near Madanapalle, on November 7 last year. A 100 member police team tracked down and arrested Rafi 10 days after the crime, while he was trying to escape to Chhattisgarh. The charge-sheet was filed 17 days after the arrest, and the trial completed 90 days after that .Keen to broadcast his government’s steps to speed up judicial closure of crimes against women, Chief Minister Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy says, It has taken eight years to punish the offenders in the Nirbhaya case, but under the Andhra Pradesh Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2019, offenders will be punished in less than a month. To be sure, there is a need for swift action in such cases, as proved by the overjoyed public reaction to the encounter killing of the four accused of the rape and murder of a 27-year-old veterinarian on November 27 last year in Hyderabad.To this end, the state administration has earmarked 18 police stations, one in each police unit, to exclusively investigate heinous crimes and crimes against women and children. These stations have adequate staff half of whom are women and have been incentivised with 30 per cent additional pay to ensure efficiency and timeliness. The forensic capabilities of the state have also been beefed up to provide technical support to these investigations, and one court in each district has been dedicated to fast-tracking such trials. A mobile-based app has also been launched for such crimes to be reported without delay.This has already led to a spurt in recorded offences. Between December 13 last year when the legislation, also known as the Andhra Pradesh Disha Bill, 2019, was adopted and the end of February 2020, there has been a 39 per cent increase in reported crimes, compared to the same period in 2018-19. Charge-sheets have been filed within seven days in 53 such cases, and trials have commenced in 20. Our experience of the past two months is that both the expectation and the standards of police performance and delivery have been raised, with [the government’s initiatives] creating a holistic ecosystem that makes delivering speedy justice possible, says the state’s director general of police Gautam Sawang.Meanwhile, the new law is awaiting the President’s assent. It provides for death sentences for the offences of rape and gang-rape, and mandates the completion of trials within 21 days. Investigations are to be completed in seven days in cases where there is conclusive evidence, with trials to be concluded in 14 working days. It also prescribes life imprisonment for other sexual offences against women and children. Those found guilty can appeal to the higher courts within 60 days after the special court pronounces the verdict, with the higher courts required to announce their final decision within 45 working days. The lawyers’ fees for victims will be paid by the government.The state’s record when it comes to women’s safety is mixed. National Crime Records Bureau data for 2018 reveals that in state rankings of crime rates, Andhra Pradesh is 11 in recorded crimes against women, #25 in registered rapes and #30 in crimes against children. It is hoped that the new law will improve this record and that other states will also take note. The new law instills a sense of fear among anti-social elements and the stringent provisions needs to replicated, says Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, who led a team to Amaravati for a first-hand appraisal of the new measures. Delhi and Odisha are among the other states said to have shown interest.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " \"\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n Congress sidles up to KanhaiyaThe popular student leader-turned-neta tempts the Congress to test a common-cause alliance with the Left.advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Amitabh Srivastava    Bihar March 6, 2020 ISSUE DATE: March 16, 2020UPDATED: March 6, 2020 11:23 IST  Rock solid Kanhaiya speaking at the packed Patna rallyCPI youth leader Kanhaiya Kumar’s Jana Gana Mana rally in Patna’s Gandhi Maidan on February 27 had two unlikely people in attendance Congress MLAs Shakeel Ahmad Khan and Awadhesh Singh shared the dais with him. Khan, a former Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) students union president like Kanhaiya, insisted later that their presence there was only to support the cause, the rally was part of a campaign against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the proposed-then-denied National Register of Citizens (NRC) but he did admit the opposition needed every like-minded party and individual on board if it was to best the JD(U)-led NDA all\\xadiance in the assembly election this October.The CPI was not part of the RJD-led five-party alliance for the Lok Sabha poll in 2019. In fact, the RJD had put up a candidate, Tanveer Hassan, in Begusarai, from where Kanhaiya contested unsucc\\xadessfully. The RJD may not be keen, but when it comes to Kanhaiya, the Congress appears to have a soft corner for the ex-student leader. If the two do come together, as some sections are hoping, it could benefit both parties in Bihar. While the CPI does not have a party organisation or a significant cadre base, the Congress lacks a frontline leader, a credible face in Bihar. Kanhaiya, with his powerful oratorical skills, could be the answer if an arr\\xadangement can be worked out between the two parties.But while there are enough reasons for a closer working relationship, there is already a spanner in the works. A top Congress leader admitted that the AAP government’s recent sanction for the prosecution of Kanhaiya and nine others in a sedition case may force a rethink by the central leadership.The maximum punishment for sedition is life imprisonment, the minimum three years. If convicted, a person cannot contest elections for six years. Kanhaiya has welcomed the prosecution decision, saying he wants a speedy trial so that the country gets to know how a law like sedition is being misused. Not many expect a verdict in the case before the Bihar assembly election but its shadow could still be too overbearing for the grand old party.A section of Congress leaders believes it may be better to ally with the Left than the undependable Jitan Ram Manjhi (Hindustani Awam Morcha) and Mukesh Sahani (Vikassheel Insaan Party). There are, however, sceptics who feel Kanhaiya does not bring much to the table apart from the support of the Muslims, who are already with the opposition.The communication deficit between RJD acting chief Tejashwi Yadav and Kanhaiya could also make it difficult to bring the two together. While Tejashwi is unlikely to cede his leadership status to anyone, Kanhaiya is also a big campaign name, says a senior Congress leader. There is also some reluctance to accept Tejashwi’s leadership in some sections of the party. We are trying to work out a middle path. Tejashwi will be told that Kanhaiya is only interested in nat\\xadional politics. But to get him on our side, the RJD scion will need to agree on whom to project as the face of the grand alliance.A senior Congress leader concedes that the dice are loaded against the opposition with the NDA’s campaign spearhead, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar of the JD(U), seemingly still enjoying the TINA (there is no alternative) factor. Nitish has the image of a performing chief minister, someone who has delivered on multiple fronts, including better roads and electricity for all. That said, the ideological faultlines between the JD(U) and BJP are also clearly visible. We can exploit the situation, but only by putting up a united front, he says.

       " \"\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n The Shah wagon rolls inAhead of elections, the BJP’s campaign pitch has taken on a new colour and texture with the home minister’s visit to the stateadvertisement\\n\\n\\n  Romita Datta  Kolkata March 6, 2020 ISSUE DATE: March 16, 2020UPDATED: March 6, 2020 19:21 IST  Amit Shah with state leaders at the Shahid Minar rally, Feb. 29The Battle for Bengal is officially on. On March 1, Union home minister Amit Shah sounded the clarion call at a big rally in central Kolkata, saying a sonar Bangla (golden Bengal) awaited the state if the Bharatiya Janata Party was elected to power in 2021. A day later, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee rolled out a massive public outreach programme, Banglar Gorbo Mamata’, while denouncing the communal violence in Delhi as a planned gen\\xadocide’ and saying the BJP was applying the Gujarat model across the country. The goli maro’ slogans heard at the rally in an eerie reprise of the incendiary slogan\\xadeering by BJP leaders in Delhi and the anti-Shah pro\\xad\\xadtests across the city by the Left and the Congress left no doubt that communal faultlines in the state were deepening.Bengal, of course, is crucial to the BJP’s larger game plan. The party has already made significant inroads in the state, winning 18 of 42 seats and 40 per cent of the vote share in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. It’s already nipping at the heels of Mamata’s TMC (Trinamool Congress) which had only four more seats in LS 2019 and the party fancies its chances of staging an upset victory in 2021.The Union home minister was in Bengal in the company of BJP national president J.P. Nadda (who app\\xadarently left his son’s wedding reception in Himachal midway to be there for the occ\\xadasion) and general secretary (organisation) B.L. Santhosh. Shah began his day in the city with a rally near Shahid Minar, an iconic monument and protest site in the city’s Esplanade area. The irony of his defence of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, even while Delhi was still on tenterhooks in the aftermath of the communal clashes over the same law, was not lost on the politically savvy city. But amid talk of the Ram temple in Ayodhya and the repeal of Article 370 in Kashmir, Shah reiterated his now-familiar refrain that Indian Muslims had nothing to fear from the new law and that the ruling TMC was only trying to fan the fear for political advantage. Shah’s reassurances were by way of damage control, but whether or not people believed him is another matter, says Prasanto Ray, professor emeritus at Presidency University.After the rally at Shahid Minar, Shah went to offer prayers at the Kalighat temple before heading to a city hotel where he met a host of leaders from the state among them, MPs and MLAs, the presidents of the 38 organisational districts, observers and general secretaries. At the over four-hour-long meeting, Shah mainly listened. The final meeting ended around midnight, after which Shah flew back to Delhi.In his meetings, Shah reassured the state functionaries of central support. In the next 390 days, till the assembly election in 2021, he said he would visit the state thrice a month for the next few months, going up to a week in the months leading to the election. Forty-two days in the last six months means Shah will cover each of the 42 Lok Sabha seats besides having a strong team to fan out in every assembly constituency, says a BJP district leader, requesting anonymity. To show how serious he is about the campaign, Shah is also seeking a place to stay in Kolkata. He is also learning Bengali, and is now peppering his speeches with Bengali words. His visit to the Kali temple, too, was of a piece with the plan to woo Bengali Hindu voters and dispel the notion that the BJP is a party of the Hindi heartland, trying to foist itself on the state.Shah’s visit was also meant to remove any suspicions in the minds of the local functionaries of a covert BJP deal with the TMC, which may have arisen following Mamata’s meetings, first with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and then with Shah at a lunch organised by Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik at his residence. He told us BJP workers should not believe rumours of an understanding, just because there had been meetings with the PM and himself, said a leader who was part of Shah’s closed-door meeting with party functionaries.Not to be outdone, Mamata went into a huddle with her partymen the day after Shah’s visit, to sharpen campaign strategies. So the TMC’s Banglar Gorbo Mamata’ (Bengal’s pride, Mamata) is said to be in response to the BJP’s Aar Noi Annyay (No More Injustice), a grievance cell’ to report corruption in the TMC regime. Somewhat on the lines of the BJP’s door-to-door campaign through vistaraks and shakha pracharaks, Mamata too has lined up a series of be humble and simple’ programmes to win back disenchanted voters. Likewise, the TMC’s Didi ke Bolo (Tell Didi), Jalojoge Jogajog (Connect over Snacks) and CAA, CAA/ Chhi, Chhi (Shame on CAA) pitches have provoked counter-campaigns in the form of Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh’s Dada ke Bolo (Tell Dada), Chai Pe Charcha (Conversations over Tea) and Abhinandan yatras.The copycat strategies, says Ray, show the BJP is running out of ideas. Didi ke Bolo is a populist initiative to plug loopholes in governance, whereas BJP’s Aar Noi Annyay has a moral overtone. If morality mattered in politics, Saradha and Narada would have had an impact. So, I doubt if the moral platitudes will serve any end, he says.The TMC is also way ahead in terms of having a credible mass leader. The BJP, on the other hand, does not even have a consensus candidate, perhaps another reason why Shah is keen on frequenting the state to figure out which way the local leadership is leaning. The TMC is also not above using the police and administrative machinery to its advantage. For now, Shah’s main strategy is blanket coverage criss-crossing Bengal, weekly rallies, dinners with Dalit karyakartas in their mud huts and visiting the families of political martyrs. Whether it will help him win Bengal, 2021 will tell.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

The Agra-born single-handedly won the match against Australia and that spell of 4 for 19 would be remembered for long. In the other matches too she has delivered every now and then to give India an edge over oppositions.

       " '\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n Hemant Soren budget takes Kejriwal model to Jharkhand, keeps Rahul Gandhi\\'s promiseThe Hemant Soren government has taken the Kejriwal model of governance to Jharkhand with its first budget. The government also kept the promise of farm loan waiver made by Rahul Gandhi during state election last year.advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Amitabh Srivastava    New DelhiMarch 4, 2020UPDATED: March 4, 2020 17:15 IST  Jharkhand finance minister Rameshwar Oraon presenting a copy of state budget to Chief Minister Hemant Soren in Ranchi. (Photo: Twitter/Dipika Pandey Singh)Arvind Kejriwal\\'s Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) may not be a force in Jharakhand, but his politics has impact on Hemant Soren government\\'s first budget. Rahul Gandhi\\'s Congress may be a junior partner in the coalition government in Jharkhand, but Hemant Soren kept the promise that the Congress leader made during the state election campaign last year.In its maiden budget, Hemant Soren government proposed to offer free electricity up to 100 units for households consuming up to 300 units of power per month. This is on the line Kejriwal government\\'s electricity policy of zero bill up to 200 units of consumption.The Hemant Soren government proposed to set up \"Mohalla Clinics\" - another pet project of Kejriwal -- and offer \"digital education\" in government schools as it underscored the need to reform school education in Jharkhand. Another Kejriwal imprint appears in universal health insurance scheme for the residents of Jharkhand.However, the biggest election promise that Hemant Soren government fulfilled with the first budget is the one made by Rahul Gandhi. It announced Rs 2,000 crore farm loan waiver scheme in his budget with the promise of waiving off loans up to Rs 50,000 per farmer.The loan waiver for farmers has been a favourite scheme of Rahul Gandhi, whose party Congress is a member of three-party rulling alliance, which unseated BJP in the assembly polls held in October 2019.Hemant Soren\\'s finance minister Rameshwar Oraon, who presented the budget, is also from Congress. Oraon tabled an estimated budget of Rs 86,370 crore for the year 2020-21. It included sops ranging from universal health insurance to farmer loan waivers, from stipends for the jobless to dhoti, sari and lungi to 57 lakh poor families twice a year at a cost of Rs 10 each. Now, ration cards are to be given to 10 lakh people aged above 50.Though the BJP-led opposition boycotted the assembly proceedings to protest against the Speaker\\'s decision of not recognizing reinducted BJP leader Babulal Marandi as leader of the Opposition, the treasury benches remained upbeat with what Hemant Soren described as \"pro-poor and inclusive\" budget.Hemant Soren said the budget aims at achieving 7.2 per cent growth rate for state GDP (Gross Domestic Product) from current 5.7 per cent, and push per capital income to Rs 65,802 from the existing Rs 62,345.The Hemant Soren government\\'s budget proposed a universal health insurance capped at Rs 5 lakh. However, the employees of state and central governments will not be covered under this scheme.The budget further proposed to provide free treatment of cancer, kidney and serious liver diseases by noted doctors to individuals in families with an annual income up to Rs 8 lakh.The budget expanded the scholarship window by offering what was so far available to ST/SC/ OBC students from Classes I to XII to students of all categories and classes. The budget also offered an additional Rs 50,000 to each beneficiary for homes under the PM Awas Yojana.The jobless graduate registered with the employment exchanges of the state will be given Rs 5,000 per year for two years. The relief sum will go up to Rs 7,000 for unemployed postgraduates.Of the Rs 73,315.94 crore that comes under revenue expenditure and Rs 13,054.06 crore under capital expenditure, the Hemant Soren government has set aside Rs 37,445.06 crore as establishment cost, Rs 34,485.72 crore for implementation of state schemes, Rs 3,315.27 crore for central schemes and Rs 11,123.95 crore for expenditure on Centre-sponsored schemes.When it comes to revenue, Rs 15,839 crore comes from grants-in-aid, Rs 11,820.34 earmarked from non-tax revenue, Rs 21,669.50 crore from the state\\'s taxes and Rs 25,979.91 crore from the state\\'s share in central taxes.Calling the budget as Hemant Soren asserted that his government looks to ensure that \"no one dies due to lack of food, water and healthcare, and children instead of graz- ing goats go to school. It is a revolutionary budget.\"Read | Jharkhand Assembly adjourned twice over BJP\\'s Leader of Opposition demandAlso read | Jharkhand: Three get death for rape in less than a month of crimeYou may like it | Another son rises in east: Hemant Soren is next Jharkhand CMFor sports news, updates, live scores and cricket fixtures, log on to indiatoday.in/sports.

       " \"\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n Sidhu is back in demandAfter winning Delhi, AAP is now courting the charismatic motormouth to revive its Punjab unitadvertisement\\n\\n\\n  Anilesh Mahajan  February 28, 2020 ISSUE DATE: March 9, 2020UPDATED: February 28, 2020 15:01 IST  What’s on his mind? Photo: Sanjeev Kumar/ Getty ImagesThe Aam Aadmi Party’s spectacular victory in the Delhi assembly election has infused new life into its fractured party organisation in Punjab. Not only is it now looking to win back rebels but also wooing cricketer-turned-Congress politician Navjot Singh Sidhu.With assembly elections in Punjab just two years away, the challenge for AAP is to reinvigorate the faction-ridden state unit and overcome the trust deficit with the people. Sidhu, state AAP leaders feel, can not only be the rallying force but also rope in smaller political entities, such as Simarjit Singh Bains’s Lok Insaaf Party.Sidhu, though, is keeping his cards close to his chest, and did not respond to messages and calls from INDIA TODAY. The Congress MLA from Amritsar East resigned from the Punjab cabinet last July amid heightened tensions with Chief Minister Amarinder Singh. He has been keeping a low profile ever since. In November 2019, Sidhu attended the inauguration of the Kartarpur Corridor, but not as part of the Punjab government delegation. He did not campaign for the Congress in the Delhi election either.AAP leaders in Punjab claim Prashant Kishor, who strategised their party’s Delhi campaign, had a word with Sidhu. If negotiations do make any headway, a major pain point will be Sidhu’s insistence on being projected as the chief ministerial candidate and being given a free hand to pick candidates. AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal will also have to factor in Sidhu’s penchant for courting controversies. There’s high recall of his controversial trip to Pakistan for prime minister Imran Khan’s swearing-in ceremony in 2018, when he was seen hugging Pakistan army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa, and his unsavoury remarks on India’s air strikes in Balakot in 2019.A key event that could shape the course of the Punjab assembly poll will be the elections to the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) next year. While the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has controlled the SGPC for over three decades, the party lost a section of the panthic vote for its unconvincing stand on incidents of desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib in 2015.AAP has attracted several Sikh politicians with an SGPC background in the past six years. Rebel Akali factions, including SAD (Taksali), are eyeing an alliance with these leaders for the SGPC poll. A defeat for the SAD in the SGPC will indirectly benefit AAP. Sidhu has clear feelers from SAD (Taksali). Sidhu is welcome to join us, but his being incommunicado does not help, says Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, the Rajya Sabha MP who has joined forces with the outfit.This is not AAP’s first attempt to woo Sidhu. After quitting the BJP in 2016, Sidhu had held inconclusive parleys with Kejriwal. On Kishor’s suggestion, he met Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka and joined the Congress ahead of the 2017 Punjab election.Outside Delhi, AAP has presence only in the Punjab assembly. The party’s lone Lok Sabha MP, Bhagwant Singh Mann, represents Sangrur in the state. In the previous assembly poll, AAP captured 20 seats and a 23.8 per cent vote share. Subsequently, MLAs Sukhpal Singh Khaira and Baldev Singh quit to launch the Punjab Ekta Dal while Amarjit Singh Sandhoa and Nazar Singh Manshahia joined the Congress. Advocate-turned-politician H.S. Phoolka resigned from his seat and MLA Kanwar Sandhu remains suspended from the party. In the 2019 Lok Sabha election, AAP polled 7.6 per cent votes in Punjab and 12 of its candidates lost their deposits. Should he join, Sidhu could be the booster shot AAP needs in Punjab. But, for now, he is keeping everyone guessing.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " \"\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n The knives are out for YediyurappaAfter repeatedly spurning the ministerial ambitions of party stalwarts and seeking to elevate his son, the chief minister faces serious dissentadvertisement\\n\\n\\n  Aravind Gowda  Karnataka February 28, 2020 ISSUE DATE: March 9, 2020UPDATED: February 28, 2020 15:00 IST  CORNERED: B.S. Yediyurappa at an event in Belagavi, Jan. 2020A campaign is building up against Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa in the ruling BJP in Karnataka. This follows the denial of ministerial berths to several party old-timers in the February 6 cabinet expansion and the chief minister’s reported bid to secure an influential post for his son B.Y. Vijayendra in the party organisation.For over a week now, two unsigned letters (in English and Kannada) have been circulating in BJP circles, citing Yediyurappa’s age and failing health’ and his attempts to empower his son, and demanding the appointment of a new chief minister. Yediyurappa, who turns 77 on February 27, has drawn the ire of senior BJP leaders, such as Umesh Katti, Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, Murugesh Nirani, M.P. Renukacharya, Siddu Savadi, Sanganna Karadi and Anand Mamani, as they were left out of the cabinet. Katti and Nirani met BJP president J.P. Nadda in the first week of February to lodge a complaint.The rebellion’ against Yediyurappa has been launched by Lingayat leaders in the state BJP. The Lingayats, the sect to which Yediyurappa also belongs, make up about 17 per cent of Karnataka’s population and have been BJP loyalists. The infighting began when BSY, beholden to the 10 MLAs who had defected from the Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) last year and helped the BJP come to power in Karnataka, was forced to accommodate them in government.There is also disgruntlement over efforts to prop up Vijayendra, with a senior BJP leader saying that dynastic rule will not be tolerated in the partyWith age catching up, Yediyurappa wants to cement positions for his sons in the BJP, says N. Prakash, a Mysuru-based political analyst. The induction of the 10 disqualified MLAs had already enraged party veterans. Yediyurappa’s supporters are ganging up on him.The appointment of the 10 MLAs itself was marked with drama, and Yediyurappa had to change the portfolios of six of them within a day. Katti has gone public with his attack on Yediyurappa. I have been a minister for 13 years. With God’s grace, my aim now is to occupy the chief minister’s post, he said.The miffed ministerial aspirants have lately been joined by more rebels’ Mohan Limbikayi, S. Munenkoppa, C.M. Nimbannavar, Aravind Bellad, Mahesh Kumtahalli and Shashikant Akkappa Naik. We will intensify our fight in March after the chief minister’s birthday celebrations, said one of them.While Yediyurappa’s followers have dismissed the letters as mischief by a few irate legislators, Prakash cautions: The issue will affect the image of the government, which has hardly anything to show in terms of performance. Yediyurappa should also downplay his son’s role in the BJP.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n Taxing TimeThe state’s new excise policy may deliver a bruising blow to tourists.advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Rohit Parihar     Jaipur February 28, 2020 ISSUE DATE: March 9, 2020UPDATED: February 28, 2020 15:00 IST  On the rocks, A restro-bar in Jaipur: Photo- PURUSHOTTAM DIWAKARRajasthan’s new excise policy for 2020-21, which has proposed a massive hike in liquor licence fees, has led to a lot of glum faces in the state’s hotel and tourism industry. The Ashok Gehlot government is looking at it as a means to tide over the massive shortfall in the state’s share in central taxes (estimated to go down by Rs 10,072 crore to Rs 36,039 crore), but along with the 20 per cent hike in liquor prices last year, the hospitality industry says the new policy will lead to another washout tourist season.On another level, the new excise policy also comes with target.(Rs 12,500 crore for 2020-21, up Rs 1,500 crore year on year) and penalties (for failing quarterly sales targ\\xadets). Liquor vend owners gave a call for a boycott of the open e-auction, forcing the government to issue advertisements on February 24 to encourage bidding. Industry insiders say with liquor in Rajasthan now 40 per cent costlier than, say, neighbouring Haryana, bootlegging and inter-state smuggling are set to rise, whereas sellers will stop issuing bills, which will, in turn, hit VAT collections, and hotels selling liquor without licence will mushroom.Other peeves of the tourism industry include the lack of permits to sell draught beer and the 30-plus clearances to sell hard liquor at restaurants. Rajasthan, which shares borders with Punjab, Haryana, UP, MP and Gujarat, has also seen a spurt in liquor smuggling in the past decade. In some areas, bootleggers now deliver liquor at home at half the rate charged at the vends.Excise officials say they have made preparations to ensure that only bottles bearing barcodes are sold though PoS machines. This, they say, will make it tough for sellers to evade taxes or indulge in selling smuggled liquor. But stakeholders feel the new excise policy unfairly targets legal licence holders and insist that had the government engaged with them, they could have offered alternative suggestions to mobilise more revenues.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Menon     Chennai February 28, 2020 ISSUE DATE: March 9, 2020UPDATED: February 28, 2020 14:59 IST  ALL for amma Chief minister Palaniswami (right) with his deputy Panneerselvam: Photo-Jason GAhead of the assembly election due in May next year, the ruling All India Anna Dra\\xadv\\xad\\xadida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) is doling out fistfuls of state largesse in the name of its late lamented leader J. Jayalalithaa. February 24 marked her 72nd birth anniversary, and it will henceforth be observed as Girl Child Protection Day in Tamil Nadu.To mark the occasion, Chief Min\\xad\\xad\\xadi\\xad\\xadster Edappadi K. Palaniswami announced five schemes for girls living in state-run homes. When orphaned/ abandoned girls turn 22, the government will deposit Rs 2 lakh in their bank accounts. For girls who face problems after leaving the homes, on turning 19, a special grant will be given to ensure their social and financial safety. It will include assistance for higher education, skill development, job opportunities and self-employment. The assistance will continue till they are 50, says Palaniswami, who also raised the monthly grant to foster par\\xadents of ado\\xadpted children from Rs 2,000 for three years to Rs 4,000 for five years.Noting that the Ammathottil’ (cradle baby) scheme, introduced by Jayalalithaa, had greatly reduced cases of female infanticide, he pointed to how the female sex ratio at birth had increased from 918 in 2014-15 to 936 in 2019. District administrations that make efforts to better it will get medals from now on, says Palaniswami. In the fifth scheme, wards of state-run homes who fulfil the employment eligibility criteria will be given preference in select categories of government jobs.Earlier, in January, the state rena\\xadmed two universities after Amma, Tamil Nadu Dr J. Jayalalithaa Fisheries University and Tamil Nadu Dr J. Jayalalithaa Music and Fine Arts University. The idea of freely invoking the late chief minister’s name is obviously to cash in on her goodwill and to try and ensure the rank and file continue to rally behind Palaniswami and deputy chief minister O. Panneerselvam.Presenting its last full-fledged budget ahead of the polls, the AIADMK government made generous allocations to its flagship welfare schemes, including Rs 6,500 crore for food subsidy, and announced interest waivers for prompt repayment of crop loans.Seeking to give fresh impetus to the low-cost Amma unavagams (canteens), it announced that mobile units would be launched to take food to construction work sites.Panneerselvam, who holds the finance portfolio, while allocating Rs 4,315 crore to the social security pension scheme, announced an addition of 173,000 new beneficiaries. The government also announced enhanced comp\\xadensation under the Amma accident-cum-life insurance scheme for BPL families, Rs 2 lakh in case of natural death of a breadwinner or a permanent disability caused by an accident and Rs 4 lakh in the case of accident deaths. Palaniswami also launched the Amma Youth Sports Scheme on January 13, providing Rs 121.2 crore to provide playground facilities and sports equipment to village and town panchayats to enthuse the rural youth. With all the Amma schemes for disadvantaged groups, the AIADMK will be hoping it has done enough to protect its vote bank next year.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n The Upper HandThe state Rajya Sabha byelections could see a nervy contest for the third sea.advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Rahul Noronha  Bhopal February 28, 2020 ISSUE DATE: March 9, 2020UPDATED: February 28, 2020 14:58 IST  Hectic lobbying has begun for nominations to the three upcoming vacancies in the Rajya Sabha (RS) from Madhya Pradesh in April. Given their current numbers in the Vidhan Sabha, both the ruling Congress and the BJP will win one seat each. The third seat is likely to see a contest. The Congress has a better chance of bagging it, but the BJP under Amit Shah has made it a norm to not give up in close contests.Currently, of the 11 RS seats from the state, the BJP has eight and the Congress three. Each candidate needs 58 votes to win a seat. At present, the Congress has 114 MLAs, the BJP 107, the SP one, the BSP two while four seats are with Independents. For the third seat, the Congress needs two more votes, which it expects will come from the ranks of the Independents, BSP and SP legislators that support the Kamal Nath government. The BJP needs nine more votes than the 107 it has to win the third seat. Party sources say a second candidate will be fielded, in the hope that infighting in the Congress will lead to cross-voting in its favour.The names of Congr\\xadess probables include Digvij\\xadaya Singh (renominated), Jyotiraditya Scindia and a few other biggies. There is even a demand to give general secretary Priyanka Gandhi a nomina\\xadt\\xadion from MP. In all likelihood, though, Scindia will be the second candidate to ensure that his flock of upset MLAs they have been demanding the PCC chief’s post for him stay with the party.As for the BJP candi\\xadd\\xadates, the sure seat is likely to go to general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya or ex-minister J.S. Pawaiya. For the third seat, state BJP spokesperson Rahul Kothari says they are confident of securing adequate numbers given that other parties and Independents may decide to support our candidates, suggesting that this April, cross-voting is a real possibility.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " \"\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n The shape of a new oppositionPrashant Kishor's recent manoeuvres hint at early moves to reconfigure the Oppositionadvertisement\\n\\n\\n  Amitabh Srivastava    Bihar February 28, 2020 ISSUE DATE: March 9, 2020UPDATED: February 28, 2020 20:12 IST  BIHAR BOY: Prashant Kishor at the Feb. 18 press conference in PatnaAt his first press conference in Patna on February 18, election strategist Prashant Kishor said he was in the state to get the Baat Bihar Ki’ initiative off the ground, the centrepiece of his pitch being a developmental push to secure for Bihar a place among the top 10 states. PK insisted he was not there to form alliances or stitch election strategies, but just two days later, he was spotted in a Delhi hotel, meeting with three leaders of the state’s erstwhile grand alliance’, former Union minister Upendra Kushwaha of the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP), ex-chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi of the Hindustani Awam Morcha-Secular (HAM-S) and Mukesh Sahni of the Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP).Although the three leaders have not said so on record, and PK maintained his development narrative even after the Delhi meeting, word is that the confabulations were about alliance strategies for the upcoming Bihar election. The three parties are still unproven electorally, but they have some claim to vote banks Kushwaha has influence among the Kushwahas or Koeris, a dominant OBC community that makes up 8 per cent of the population in Bihar; Manjhi feels the 4 per cent Musahar vote is his own; and Sahni counts on the support of the EBC Mallah boatmen.But why were the three meeting without a repr\\xadesentative of the biggest opposition player, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) around? The idea, political observers say, is to pressure the RJD to fall in line. A Nitish Kumar-led NDA will find it much easier if someone from the RJD first family [read: Tejashwi Yadav] were projected as the CM candidate, said a leader present at the Delhi meeting, on condition of anonymity. Note the JD(U) pitch: our 15 years versus the RJD’s 15 years’. Nitish wins that perception battle hands down.The idea, then, is to deny the NDA that easy target. The RJD is the NDA’s favourite punching bag; we want to change that narrative. If it works, the NDA won’t find it so easy to take us on, he says.The argument has some merit. The RJD with its traditional M-Y voter base of Muslims (16.5 per cent) and Yadavs (14 per cent) is no doubt formidable, but in a rainbow coalition, it is also a vulnerability, as other potential support groupssuch as the Kushwahas, Dalits and Mallahs baulk at the prospect of going with a formation where the M-Y bloc is dominant. The M-Y vote bank can be decisive in a triangular or four-cornered contest, but in a bipolar contest, it is just not enough to swing the election.Even before meeting Kishor in Delhi, the three opposition leaders were unconvinced about Tejashwi’s leadership. Lalu Prasad Yadav’s chosen heir seems to have made up his mind against letting the three parties have a larger share than he thinks is legitimate. The RJD will fight at least 150 of the 243 assembly seats in Bihar, says a senior RJD leader. The Congress will get a larger share of the remaining seats. The other allies will get what is left. They can take it or leave it.The aggressive posturing by the three leaders has triggered much speculation in Bihar’s political circles. Is there space for a new opposition in the state? Bihar has often been described as a state of three principal partiesthe JD(U), BJP and RJD. The Congress and Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) are fourth and fifth in this pecking order, and perform well only when they back the winning horse. By themselves, the three first movers lack the necessary ballast, but they might count on PK, the ace election strategist, to help stitch a new-look winning combination. The 2019 Lok Sabha poll numbers suggest the three parties, along with Congress, can make a dent. The Congress bagged 7.8 per cent of the vote, RLSP (3.7 per cent), HAM-S (2.4 per cent) and VIP 1.7 per cent. Their combined 15.6 per cent vote plus the RJD’s 15.7 per cent add up to a sizeable vote share. But a reconstituted opposition is far from a done deal, and as Bihar Congress president M.M. Jha told INDIA TODAY on June 24, the actual seat distribution would involve many practicalities.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " '\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n Fuelling ProtestsTamil Nadu Chief Minister Palaniswami\\'s move to declare the Cauvery delta a protected agri zone is both eco-friendly and politically expedient, but it is not likely to pass musteradvertisement\\n\\n\\n  Amarnath K. Menon     Chennai February 21, 2020 ISSUE DATE: March 2, 2020UPDATED: February 21, 2020 13:36 IST  No drilling: Villagers at Neduvasal, Pudukottai, protesting hydrocarbon exploration in the Cauvery delta. (Photo: Jaison G)On February 10, Tamil Nadu chief minister E.K. Palaniswami announced that the Cauvery delta would be declared a Protected Special Agricultural Zone (PSAZ) to accord primacy to the state\\'s food security and to protect farmers\\' livelihoods. Over the past four decades, the delta\\'s share of the state\\'s food production has fallen from 65 per cent to 40 per cent. A major cause of this decline is hydrocarbon exploration. In recent years, there have been many protests against such projects, which not only occupy fertile agricultural lands but also cause ecological damage.The chief minister\\'s announcement followed his objection, in January, to a unilateral amendment by the Union government to the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification, 2006. This amendment relaxed the environmental clearance requirements for oil and gas exploration. \"The state government will not permit hydrocarbon exploration in the delta region, which would affect the livelihood of farmers,\" announced the chief minister. He has also reportedly written to the Centre for support in creating the PSAZ, which will include parts of Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam, Pudukottai, Cuddalore, Ariyalur, Karur and Tiruchirapalli. These areas make up the state\\'s rice bowl and produce about 3.3 million tonnes of grain every year.Farmers have long opposed hydrocarbon projects in the delta, pointing to the damage they cause, such as groundwater contamination. Agriculture scientist M.S. Swaminathan has also endorsed the chief minister\\'s plan: \"Areas identified for PSAZ status should be given facilities to ensure that agriculture remains economically viable. This is an important step to ensure the future of our food and ecological security.\"The chief minister\\'s plan is to allow only agriculture and allied industries in the region. \"Enacting specific legislation to protect the region, though welcome, is inadequate,\" says Professor S. Janakarajan, president of the South Asia Consortium for Interdisciplinary Water Resources Studies. \"There are grey areas. The state cannot act unilaterally, ignoring central government laws that permit entities like ONGC to take up [hydrocarbon] exploration. Another serious concern is the fracking technology these entities rely on. It has already been banned in several countries for the ecological harm it causes. Issues like these have to be addressed for any meaningful protection of the delta.\"The state has, in the past, taken note of, and acted on, farmers\\' protests. In 2013, Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa had ordered the suspension of coal-bed methane exploration and production in Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts, following it up with a ban in 2015. However, in 2017, the Centre signed contracts for hydrocarbon extraction in 31 locations in the state. With an eye on investments over Rs 90,000 crore, the state government also notified 45 villages in the Cuddalore and Nagapattinam districts in the delta as part of a Petroleum, Chemical and Petrochemical Investment Region that year. (Chief Minister Palaniswami\\'s proposed PSAZ puts a question mark on this ambitious scheme.) Then, in 2019, the central government also allowed Vedanta Ltd to conduct impact assessment studies to drill 274 offshore and onshore hydrocarbon wells in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.Facts like these will make it difficult for the chief minister to walk the talk. He has to get the ministry of petroleum and natural resources on the same page and get the Union government to agree to the proposed PSAZ. This will be all the more difficult since the Centre\\'s move to relax the rules for hydrocarbon firms is aimed at incentivising increased production in India to address the country\\'s high oil-import dependence. The Tamil Nadu government will face both pressure from the Union government and litigation from firms that have already invested significant sums in such projects, which could lead to adverse consequences for investment in the state.At the same time, the chief minister is also using this issue to score points off the rival DMK. The PSAZ tag was a central poll plank of all political parties in the state, both in the previous assembly election and in last year\\'s Lok Sabha election. By winning 29 of the 45 assembly seats in the delta region in the 2016 assembly election, the AIADMK had conquered what was seen as a DMK stronghold. However, by winning all but one of the 40 Lok Sabha seats in the state and Puducherry last summer, the DMK-led alliance showed that it had regained the upper hand. Moreover, the party managed to win over half the votes in the Cauvery delta, particularly in Thanjavur and Nagapattinam, in local body elections in December 2019.Some analysts wonder, therefore, if the chief minister\\'s announcement was made primarily with an eye on the 2021 assembly poll.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " '\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n Uddhav\\'s Waiver BountyCan the Maharashtra government afford the exorbitant loan-waiver bill?advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Kiran D. Tare  Mumbai February 21, 2020 ISSUE DATE: March 2, 2020UPDATED: February 21, 2020 13:34 IST  Ground work: Uddhav Thackeray with farmers in Sangli. (Photo: Raju Sanadi)Maharashtra officials are busy setting in motion Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray\\'s ambitious scheme to waive farmers\\' loans upto Rs 2 lakh. The government has begun a pilot run of the scheme before its official launch on February 21, even as Thackeray, speaking in Jalgaon on February 16, reiterated that he was committed to alleviating farmers\\' distress since he had come to power with their blessings. The chief minister has also instructed officials to be \\'sensitive\\'. \"Do not think you are doing farmers a favour by waiving their loans,\" he told them recently.The state government says the loan waiver will benefit 3.64 million farmers. Prodded by Thackeray, the cooperative department has developed a portal for the scheme, on which data of about 3.22 million farmers has already been uploaded. Eligible farmers will have to authenticate themselves with Aadhaar IDs-for which 96,000 centres have been set up-and biometrics. Government data shows almost 95 per cent of the beneficiaries have Aadhaar-linked bank accounts. Thackeray praised officials for completing the ground work in a span of 15 days. \"This is the country\\'s biggest loan-waiver scheme; I want you to be sensible in its implementation,\" he said.At Rs 40,000 crore, the one-time loan waiver will be one of the country\\'s most expensive. To fund it, the Maharashtra government may have to curtail allocations to some other departments by 20-30 per cent. Given the state\\'s total debt of Rs 4.72 lakh crore (2019-20), about 17 per cent of its GDP, some experts have panned the scheme as an ill-conceived misadventure.The loan waiver will benefit some 3.64 million farmers. Thackeray says it\\'s the country\\'s biggest such schemeA cooperative department official says Thackeray wants a smooth rollout of the scheme, as a similar initiative by the erstwhile BJP-Shiv Sena government had suffered from technical glitches. \"We have taken utmost care so that the new scheme is implemented in a foolproof manner,\" says the official.Keen to dispel the notion in some quarters that he is an \\'urban politician\\' who knows little about agrarian issues, Thackeray kept the agriculture portfolio with his party and gave charge of the ministry to Dadaji Bhuse, a farmer. The ministry has set up farmer assistance centres in each of the state\\'s 350 talukas and launched a portal that allows farmers a single-window application for all agri schemes. \"Farmers no longer need to file the same application year after year,\" says Bhuse.Beginning February 16, Bhuse has been visiting farmers to get a first-hand assessment of their problems. In Bhuse\\'s assembly constituency of Malegaon Outer, farmer Shantaram Gawali complained to him about problems in getting crop loans and seeds.The exercise is expected to throw up a litany of problems. Farmers have been complaining about not receiving the minimum support price (MSP) for their produce. Suhas Bhatkar, a farmer from Amravati, says he sold cotton at Rs 5,200 per quintal whereas the MSP is Rs 5,500. Others have complained that they had to sell tur dal at Rs 4,900 a tonne and chickpea at Rs 4,300 per tonne, as against the MSP of Rs 5,800 and Rs 4,800, respectively.Agriculture expert Vijay Jawandhiya says the Thackeray government has failed to take steps to augment farm incomes. He says he wrote to Thackeray for an additional assistance of Rs 10,000 per acre for farmers, but has \"not received any response yet\".Rs 40,000 crore is what the one-time loan waiver scheme will cost the state exchequerWhile the BJP\\'s Vinod Tawde says Thackeray \"lacks innovative ideas\", Jawandhiya says loan waivers cannot be a long-term solution. \"Sharad Pawar had demanded that orange farmers be compensated for losses due to unseasonal rains,\" he adds. \"I want to know from the government what happened to that demand.\"Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Menon     Hyderabad February 21, 2020 ISSUE DATE: March 2, 2020UPDATED: February 21, 2020 13:28 IST  Appetite for reform: K. Chandrashekar Rao addresses district collectors in Hyderabad, Aug. 2019. (File photo)Telangana chief minister K. Chandrashekar Rao is reforming the state\\'s revenue administration, ushering in a new unified revenue law. As a first step, he has restructured the district administration: instead of being assisted by a single deputy collector, district collectors will now be supported by two additional collectors, one of whom will attend exclusively to local bodies while the other will be tasked with making panchayats more efficient.On February 11, the chief minister explained his plans at a specially convened district collectors\\' conference. \"Implementing government policies for welfare and development should be a priority,\" he said. In aid of this, authorities will be allowed to take measures for development to make their districts self-sufficient. This includes monetising local assets to increase revenue. \"The administration can be streamlined by strengthening the institution of collectors,\" added the chief minister. \"Collectors have been given more powers.\" One such is the authority to rectify land records. Treating land as a key source of income, under the proposed new revenue law, every bit of land will be accounted for, with officials ensuring that ownership disputes are resolved and clear land titles issued. Revenue tribunals are proposed in every district to dispose of disputes and simplify land ownership.Telangana spends nearly half its revenue on welfare and developmentImproving the state\\'s finances is a big concern, since Telangana spends almost 50 per cent of its revenue-about Rs 40,000 crore-on welfare and development initiatives. The chief minister is unwilling to curtail any of these schemes, even as a belt-tightening measure. \"Telangana is facing a [financial] shortfall due to the huge cut in central taxes as well as the Centre avoiding paying GST dues,\" says B. Vinod Kumar, vice chairman of the state planning and development board. \"The Centre has also decided not to approve the 15th Finance Commission\\'s recommendation to give [Telangana] a special grant of Rs 723 crore for 2020-21.\"Over the next five years, Telangana requires Rs 40,170 crore for its lift irrigation projects and Rs 12,770 crore for Mission Bhagiratha, its piped domestic water supply scheme. To keep these and other schemes going, the state may have to raise taxes to at least partly make up for the shortfall in funding.

(Photo: Somnath Sen)Everyone, irrespective of caste and community, is entitled to quality education. The family\\'s financial constraints cannot be allowed to become an impediment. Deputy commissioner, Gumla, take cognisance of the report, do the needful and update.\"This was Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren\\'s tweet on February 14, with which he tagged a newspaper report on how Amisha, a state-level school topper, was struggling to pursue her education because of financial hardships. The post had an electrifying effect. Within three days, Gumla deputy commissioner Shashi Ranjan met Amisha\\'s parents and assured them of help. \"We are making all arrangements so that Amisha, who is studying in Ranchi, faces no hindrance in her studies,\" Ranjan told India Today.From ordering an air ambulance for a girl facing renal failure to reuniting a homeless woman with her son, from providing relief to a dead army jawan\\'s wife to ordering a probe into how tribal land was transferred to a hospital, Soren has turned Twitter into a governance tool. Since assuming charge on December 29, he has sent more than 250 tweets related to governance matters, keeping officials on their toes. Now, the chief minister\\'s Twitter handle is regularly tagged by people airing their grievances on social media. Once Soren takes up these complaints, his office pursues them. Sources in the chief minister\\'s office (CMO) say Soren\\'s Twitter handle is managed by the same team that ran his social media campaign during the assembly election.The headstrong Soren of his first stint as Jharkhand chief minister (July 2013 to December 2014)-when he fired three ministers from his cabinet despite his government\\'s wafer-thin majority-appears to have reinvented himself. In his second innings, he has really upped the outreach of the CMO.Soren\\'s tweets are advertising his outreach and keeping officials on their toesSoren started his tenure with the magnanimous gesture of dropping an FIR he had filed during the election campaign against his predecessor Raghubar Das. But he vows to remain unsparing of officials who have pending cases against them. Like additional director general of police Anurag Gupta, whose suspension he ordered on February 14; Gupta is accused of misusing his position in the 2016 Rajya Sabha election. While the Election Commission had ordered departmental action against Gupta in June 2017 and an FIR was subsequently registered, the Das government did not pursue the case. \"Soren could have suspended Gupta immediately after taking over but he took more than 45 days to do so. The idea is to not appear to be someone who has scores to settle,\" says a senior IPS officer, on condition of anonymity.Soren has also ordered a scrutiny of projects undertaken by the road construction department, which was headed by Das. Sources say discrepancies have surfaced in the rates fixed for construction work in this and other departments during Das\\'s tenure.However, bureaucrats are apprehensive that the Soren government may go soft on radical tribal activists. Soren\\'s first cabinet meeting, in which it was decided to drop sedition cases against Pathalgadi movement leaders, kindled these fears. However, he has sought to ally those fears by visiting, this January, the homes of seven villagers killed in an alleged strike by pro-Pathalgadi elements in West Singhbhum district and issuing a warning that such incidents would not be tolerated.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " '\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n No Child\\'s PlayIn a real-life drama that beggars belief, a classroom play has become grounds for seditionadvertisement\\n\\n\\n  Amarnath K. Menon     Bidar February 21, 2020 ISSUE DATE: March 2, 2020UPDATED: February 21, 2020 13:19 IST  Going by the book? A class in session at a Shaheen Group school in Bidar. (Photo: K Shiva)There seems to be no end to the Kafkaesque nightmare a small school skit has triggered in Bidar, Karnataka. It was meant to be an in-house performance, but a proud parent, Muhammad Yousuf Raheem, decided to stream it on Facebook. Local BJP activist Nilesh Rakshyal took note, and lodged a police complaint stating that children were being instigated into uttering unpatriotic words, hurling abuses at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and being trained to say that if the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) came into force, Muslims would have to leave the country.The police, of course, wasted no time acting on the complaint. Storming into the school (whose spacious facilities on the five-acre campus they have regularly used for hosting police programmes), a posse of policemen, some in uniform, tried to identify the students who had participated in the play as well as 85 others who watched it. This went on for five days and many children stopped coming to school for fear of being questioned by the police. Never mind that the Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights pulled up the police for violating the norms of the Juvenile Justice Act and asked them to stop questioning the children. \"When the children were being questioned, their parents or guardians should have been present and the police should not have gone in uniform,\" says the commission\\'s chairman, Antony Sebastian, also a juvenile justice advocate.Before long, the police booked Abdul Qadeer, founder-chairman of the Allama Iqbal Educational Society and Shaheen Group of Institutions; Fareeda Begum, 50, headmistress of the Shaheen Urdu Primary School; Najibunnisa, the 46-year-old single mother of the girl who uttered the controversial lines on Modi, and four others, under Sections 504, 505 (2), 124 A, 153A and 34 of the Indian Penal Code. Both Fareeda (whose husband is a part-time mechanic) and Najibunnisa, the breadwinners of their families, were in Bidar Central Prison for a fortnight.Ordering the conditional release of the women on February 14, Bidar principal and district sessions judge Managoli Premavathi observed: \"The drama shows that the children have condemned enforcement laws. No other community has been named; all they have said is Muslims will have to leave the country.\" In its bail order, the court observed that the women had not been named in the original FIR. It was the remand memo that noted that the children had allegedly said they were asked by Fareeda to enact the play. Similarly, the child who \\'spoke derogatory words [referring to] using a chappal against Prime Minister Narendra Modi\\' revealed in her interrogation that her mother (Najibunnisa) had asked her to use the words.School authorities point out that the performance was part of routine classroom activity. Seven students, aged between nine and 12, had been asked to put up a six-minute performance on the NRC on January 21. \"A key element of the National Curriculum Framework stipulates creating awareness on contemporary social issues. This was just another assignment given to students,\" claims Thouseef Madikeri, CEO of the Shaheen Education Foundation. Now, the Karnataka High Court has to decide if the student play was a creative or literary activity within the ambit of freedom of expression. It is likely to decide by February 25 whether or not Qadeer and the four other accused should be arrested and tried on sedition and related charges. \"Every citizen of the country has the right to oppose a law intended to be brought into force and this cannot be treated as sedition,\" says Keshavarao H. Srimale, one of the lawyers who moved the bail application for the two women. \"Further, since there is no reference to any other community, there is no question of causing disharmony among communities.\"Following the initial outcry by politicians, including former chief minister Siddaramaiah, the police are treading cautiously. \"We are awaiting the findings of the forensic analysis of the surveillance camera footage from the school\\'s recordings for a fuller understanding of the course of events to act on the charges against the accused,\" said a senior police officer. Activists in Bidar argue that it is a motivated complaint as the anti-NRC rally on December 23 drew a huge response. \"Several disparate groups got together for a common cause under the banner of a secular forum. This has turned out to be unsettling for the BJP,\" said Mansoor Ahmed Quadri, district president of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen.Proving the charge of sedition (for which the maximum punishment is life imprisonment) is easier said than done. A five-judge constitutional bench of the Supreme Court presided over by Chief Justice Bhuvaneshwar Prasad Sinha in Kedar Nath Singh vs State of Bihar (1962) laid down the guiding principles for dealing with offences under Section 124A of the IPC. The judges ruled that \\'comments, however strongly worded, expressing disapprobation of the actions of the government, without exciting those feelings that generate the inclination to cause public disorder by acts of violence\\', would not be penalised. \"Disloyalty to government established by law is not the same thing as commenting in strong terms upon the measures or acts of government, or its agencies, so as to ameliorate the condition of the people or to secure the cancellation or alteration of those acts or measures by lawful means... without exciting those feelings of enmity and disloyalty which imply excitement to public disorder or use of violence.\\'Besides, the sedition law itself has other limitations. \"It uses words that are amenable to multiple interpretations. It also relies on the perception in the mind of the listener, adding to the potential for misuse,\" says Kunal Ambasta, who teaches at the National Law School of India University, Bengaluru.Mainstreaming the MarginalisedShaheen is the mythical bird that flies farther than a falcon. That is what the educational enterprise that blends modern formal education with religious teachings from the Quran strives to achieve progressively. Soaring higher. It is also the school motto. What Abdul Qadeer started as a single-room facility with 18 students in 1989-while searching for a good school for a younger sibling-is today a full-fledged facility. \"In Bidar alone, there are 9,000 students from 23 states and nine countries with diverse backgrounds,\" says Dr Thouseef Madikeri, CEO, Shaheen Education Foundation. The 43 institutions across nine states are expected to go up to 55 in 13 states by the next academic year. \"Many more who go to the traditional madrassas for religious learning alone, especially in the north, need to be exposed to quality modern education,\" he says. More than a brick in the wall: Shaheen Education Foundation School.Madikeri takes pride in the fact that Shaheen students excel in the entrance exams to professional colleges; last year, 327 of them secured medical college seats through the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test. The educational enterprise is also known for its successful experiments like the Academic Intensive Care Unit, which takes charge of dropouts besides mainstreaming those exposed only to madrassa education. About 500 are admitted to the AICU every year and its alumni are now among those pursuing collegiate education at the Jamia Millia Islamia and the Aligarh Muslim University. This is enabling Hafizes (those who memorise the Quran) get modern education.Although its tuition fee is in line with quality private schools, the Shaheen Group extends concessions and scholarships to deserving indigent students. It also takes in students from socially and economically backward communities while wearing the \\'minority\\' institution tag.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " \"\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n Wanted: An officer and an allyThe bureaucracy and the police in the state are engaged in a tug of war. for now, it’s advantage babus.advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Rahul Noronha  Madhya Pradesh February 14, 2020 ISSUE DATE: February 24, 2020UPDATED: February 14, 2020 15:32 IST  Top cop state DGP VK Singh (r) with Chief Minister Kamal NathA little more than a year into its term, the Kamal Nath government has begun the process of replacing state DGP (director general of police) V.K. Singh, who took over at the end of January 2019 as the second DGP to serve this government. This has triggered a political storm, with opposition BJP legislators accusing the government of targeting honest officers’. True or not, there is certainly a shake-up taking place on February 10, 52 IPS officers in the state were transferred, many of them within six months to a year of assuming office.There are many theories about why the state government is looking to replace the DGP. One possible flashpoint is the tussle between the IAS and the IPS over an incident on January 19. On that day, at a pro-CAA rally in Rajgarh, allegedly taken out despite prohibitory orders, a law and order situation developed when district collector Nidhi Nivedita and other officials tried to prevent the rally. In the ensuing scuffle, Nivedita allegedly slapped an assistant sub-inspector, which led to him filing a complaint with the Rajgarh superintendent of police. While the political executive and the IAS broadly supported the collector, sources say DGP Singh asked for a report to be filed after an inquiry by a DSP (deputy superintendent of police) level officer. The report, which found the collector guilty, was then forwarded to the home department. This infuriated IAS officers in the state, who have been pushing CM Nath to replace DGP Singh.Sources say Singh’s position has been precarious for some time. Although he was appointed in January 2019, his confirmation has been pending for months. Based on a Supreme Court ruling for the selection of DGPs issued following the Prakash Singh vs Union of India case to reduce political control over such appointments the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is required to send state governments a list of three officers from which they may select a DGP. In November last year, the UPSC had sent the MP government such a list, naming IPS officers V.K. Singh, M.S. Gupta and V.K. Johri. On February 8 this year, the government wrote back, rejecting the list because one of the three, V.K. Johri had not submitted a written consent to be considered for the post. It has asked the UPSC to submit a fresh list.All eyes are now on the UPSC. If it resends the same names, the state government will likely continue with Singh. (Some suggest the government is not actually interested in replacing him, and that this effort is only aimed at reining him in.) Alternatively, the new list could suggest other officers, including special investigation team chief Rajendra Kumar the IAS favourite for the post, currently in charge of the investigation into the infamous honey-trap scandal.For the moment, opposition leaders are using the issue to hit out at the administration. The government wants yes-men, even if having them affects law and order, says former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Even the Congress seems divided, with state minister for general administration Govind Singh saying DGP Singh was merely fulfilling his duties.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Menon     Chennai February 14, 2020 ISSUE DATE: February 24, 2020UPDATED: February 14, 2020 15:31 IST  Now playing Rajinikanth in ChennaiOn January 14, Tamil superstar Rajinikanth targeted the Dravidar Kazhagam (DK), the springboard that launched both the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) by criticising party ideologue, the revered late Periyar’ E.V. Ramasamy. Rajini’s focus was on Periyar’s distaste for Hindu deities and forms of worship. Expectedly, the Dravidian parties took umbrage, but the superstar refused to back down.On February 5, the actor and wannabe politician called the media to declare that certain political parties were instigating protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA for political gains and that the National Population Register (NPR) was very essential. Just so happens that the release of a new Rajini-starrer Thalaivar 168 is round the corner, and a cursory look at the script of the past couple of years indicates that Rajini’s interest in politics perks up every time a new film is due out.But now there’s the added impetus of the launch of his political party which, sources say, will happen after the puthaandu (Tamil New Year Day on April 14). This is where the anti-Periyar comments, made at the golden jubilee celebrations function for Thuglak magazine (now run by RSS ideologue S. Gurumurthy) and his pro-CAA comments have led some to ask whether an arrangement with the BJP is on the cards. Rajini himself has pooh-poohed the idea, and says he will rally those political forces inimical to the DMK or AIADMK to form a third alternative. Analysts say he is aiming to fill the vacuum left by the passing of top leaders in the two big Dravidian parties. While the DMK, led by the late Karunanidhi’s son M.K. Stalin is still a formidable cadre-based party, the AIADMK, now steered by the duo of chief minister E.K. Palaniswami and his deputy O. Panneerselvam, could find it difficult to hold on to its rank and file as elections near.Rajini has been talking about joining politics and floating a party for over two years now. He has promised aanmiga arasiyal (truthful politics) without elaborating on how he will pursue such a goal. Local committees have also been set up at all levels through his fan clubs, under the aegis of the Rajini Makkal Mandram. For many years now, the actor had also reportedly been in regular touch with Cho Ramaswamy (the late Thuglak editor) and his successor Gurumurthy.G. Palanithurai, former head of political science and development administration at Gandhigram Rural Institute in Dindigul, feels the time is ripe for a change. The people are disillusioned with the corruption in the two big Dravidian parties. The BJP will back him. Smaller parties will also join Rajini, as they did with the People’s Welfare Front steered by DMDK’s Vijayakanth in 2016. The Dravidian ethos has faded, this will help Rajini against his critics, he says.Meanwhile, on the acting front, Rajini’s films have not exactly been raking it in the way they did in the past. Indeed, his latest release, Darbar, which came out on January 9, did so poorly that the film’s distributors protested outside his house demanding compensation.Rajini’s critics say his always imminent shift to politics is just a lot of hype. He projects himself as a natural alternative to the bad Dravidian model of governance’, but he has not backed it with anything concrete. As of now, he has nothing new to offer, says political analyst N. Sathiya Moorthy. Also, his rivals will surely go on the offensive over his recent income tax case. It can seriously dent his Mr Clean image.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?    Awesome!

The focus, says a senior leader, is to expand the party’s base, which has long been seen as a party of Muslims and Yadavs. Leader of the opposition and Lalu’s chosen heir Tejashwi Yadav said as much on February 9 when he described the RJD as a party of A to Z, and not just of some caste and communities.As part of this plan, the RJD has given 45 per cent reservation to members of Scheduled Castes and Tribes and the Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs) in party posts. For the first time since its formation, the RJD has more EBCs (14) heading its district units than Yadavs (12). There are also six Muslim district presidents.The RJD’s focus on EBCs, the core supporters of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s JD(U), is understandable. Even though it enjoys the support of the Yadavs and can count on a sizeable chunk of the state’s Muslim voters, this M-Y combination’ has repeatedly failed to win the state for the RJD. This is largely because Nitish has a similar consolidation of EBCs and Mahadalits behind him.The RJD knew that with its 2014 tally of about 30 per cent votes, it was no match for the NDA in Bihar, says an RJD leader. The way forward was to empower new leaders from other social groups. Instead, we chose to lean on leaders of smaller caste-based parties like Mukesh Sahni, Jitan Ram Manjhi and Upendra Kushwaha. We depended on them and when they failed, we too failed.The first winds of change were visible in November 2019 when the RJD chose upper-caste Rajput leader Jagdanand Singh to head its state unit in Bihar. It was quite a shift for a party that had even last year protested a 10 per cent reservation for the upper castes.Singh was brought in just a month after the RJD won two of the five assembly seats that went for bypolls. For a party that had seen a wipeout in the Lok Sabha election, the victories came as the first signs of a revival.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Within three months of the launch, it had become a hit. The duo told the cops they had tied up with local vendors and were able to deliver liquor in Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali within 30 minutes of an order. Some four years later, the two are still facing trial even as the Punjab government has decided to test the model. The new excise policy has zeroed in on Mohali to try out the online delivery model.Punjab, known for its Patiala pegs’, with annual per capita consumption at 7.9 litres, is next only to Kerala (8.4 litres) in its fondness for liquor. And Mohali, home to students and young professionals is fertile ground for this experiment. But it won’t be easy or risk-free.The government knows this and is treading cautiously. Recent findings of a survey by the National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre at AIIMS, New Delhi, highlights the pitfalls. According to the survey, some 120,000 minors, in the 10-17 age group, in Punjab consume alcohol. The Capt. Amarinder Singh-led Congress government is also aware that drugs and intoxicants were a major political issue in the previous assembly election. The state excise department is communicating with major liquor vendors, and says the new policy will not be implemented if there is any resistance.The opposition Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) is already raising a hue and cry. It says the proposal violates Article 47 of the Constitution, which says that states should endeavour to implement prohibition, making an exception only for medicinal use. Party secretary Daljit Singh Cheema says that for a government that came to power promising jobs for the youth of every household, this policy is completely counter-productive.But for cash-strapped Punjab, excise on liquor is a big source of revenue. This year, the state expects to rake in Rs 5,676 crore, while the new excise policy promises over Rs 6,250 crore next year. The home delivery scheme could be a big money-spinner.Punjab is not the first state to toy with the idea. The previous Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP government in Maharashtra had also come up with a proposal to sell liquor online, but it fell through. Karnataka too tried, and failed. Given this history and the fact that other major liquor-consuming states, such as Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Haryana, are looking at ways to limit availability, the Punjab proposal is not likely to be popular.Advocates of the online liquor delivery proposal argue that it would promote responsible consumption, which echoes the Fadnavis government’s logic that it would curb drunk driving.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n The killing fieldsRajasthan’s farms have borne the brunt of the damage caused by locust swarms since December last year.advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Rohit Parihar     Rajasthan February 14, 2020 ISSUE DATE: February 24, 2020UPDATED: February 14, 2020 15:29 IST  On February 7, Union minister for agriculture Narendra Singh Tomar informed the Rajya Sabha that almost 170,000 hectares of crop in Rajasthan and Gujarat had been damaged by locust swarms in the past few months, with about 80 per cent of the damage reported from Rajasthan. As much as 88 per cent of affected land saw crop loss of 33 per cent or more, with almost 135,000 hectares in Rajasthan sustaining severe damage.Although this problem has been months in the making, its arrival in India seems to have caught officials unprepared. Locust swarms were first reported as migrating east from Yemen, Saudi Arabia and southwest Iran as early as January 2019, with early reports of their arrival in India in May. Nonetheless, the central and state governments spent the past two months passing the buck before settling on blaming Pakistan for not issuing warnings early enough. However, a bulletin published by the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization on December 18 last year warned that swarms of adult locusts were expected to soon arrive in India from southwest Pakistan.So far, at least two countries, Somalia and Pakistan have declared national emergencies. On February 4, Rajasthan minister for revenue Harish Chaudhury wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging that India follow suit and declare the locust swarms a national calamity’. About 150,000 hectares of crop in the state have been damaged. Crops affected include cumin, mustard, isabgol, taramira, castor and wheat. About 54,000 affected farmers have been identified to receive compensation, with the Rajasthan government allocating about Rs 100 crore for the purpose. Revenue minister Chaudhury says that Union and state governments were caught off guard, with [the state] machinery collapsing. Farmers saved their crops with their own efforts. In Rajasthan, the maximum damage has been reported in Jalore district, with about 60,000 hectares of farmland affected. Jaisalmer saw damage to 55,000 hectares, with 30,000 hectares in Barmer and 1,000 hectares each in Jodhpur and Sri Ganganagar districts also affected. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has reportedly released about Rs 100 crore as compensation through the state disaster management fund, though estimates of total damage exceed Rs 150 crore. State officials expect that farmers will also receive further compensation through crop insurance schemes.India last faced a major locust threat in 2007. Locust control is largely the Centre’s responsibility. The Locust Warning Organisation (LWO), established 1939, is headquartered in Jodhpur and tasked with monitoring and controlling the insects in the desert areas of Rajasthan and Gujarat. It also liaises with other agencies concerned. However, the LWO field centres are crippled by shortages of staff and machines, with equipment both old and obsolete. State governments have had to supplement these, with Rajasthan providing 100 vehicles for surveys, 450 sprayer-mounted tractors for control operations and 50,000 litres of pesticides. The government has also deployed drones to spray insecticides, but has avoided doing so with helicopters for fear of causing ecological damage. However, ground reports suggest that indiscriminate use of pesticides by farmers has caused significant soil and groundwater pollution.While minor locust infestations were reported last summer, authorities were slow to react. Experts suspect that this allowed locusts to breed, with new swarms also reportedly entering into Gujarat through uninhabited areas on the Indo-Pakistani border. Although attempts were made to control the problem fire engines were used to spray trees sheltering locusts at night factors such as an unfavourable wind direction made the problem worse. The direction of the wind is significant in determining the course a locust swarm takes; it is therefore difficult to predict the direction a swarm will migrate in. Another factor to bear in mind is that locust swarms can travel as much as 150 km in a single day, given favourable winds. These insects are also voracious eaters. A very small swarm’, say reports, can consume as much as 35,000 people can in a single day.For the opposition BJP in Rajasthan, the problem has presented an opportunity to charge the state government with poor governance. On January 24, BJP MLA Bihari Lal entered the Vidhan Sabha premises carrying a basket full of locusts to highlight the problem. On the other hand, state officials say their efforts with some help from the wind prevented damage at a much larger scale.On February 3, Union MoS for agriculture Parshottam Khodabhai Rupala informed the Rajya Sabha that the government would invite representatives from 30 locust-affected countries to prepare a roadmap to deal with the problem in future. Although the bigger swarms seem to have gone, for now, the UN and the Government of India are both expecting a rerun of the crisis around the monsoon. Hopefully, by then, state and central officials will have implemented coordinated mechanisms to deal with the threat.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " \"\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n We will have theatre commands by 2022: Bipin RawatIndia's first Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat explains why he will be the armed forces officer to watch as he drives reform in the defence ministry.advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Sandeep Unnithan     February 7, 2020 ISSUE DATE: February 17, 2020UPDATED: February 7, 2020 14:46 IST  (Photo: Pankaj Nangia/ Mail Today)From creating theatre commands-a single geographical command integrating assets of two or more services-to working within budgetary constraints, India's first Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Gen. Bipin Rawat explains why he will be the armed forces officer to watch as he drives reform in the defence ministry. Excerpts from an exclusive interview with Sandeep Unnithan:On creating new integrated tri-services theatre commands: We will have theatre commands by 2021-22. Whether you have only western commands or two western commands or two China commands or one China command, will depend on various factors. We are carrying out a complete analysis of these areas and, then, we will see what resources are needed.On how Indian Air Force (IAF) fighter planes will be distributed in theatre commands: In the army, a division has a smaller artillery brigade, but when it goes in to attack, it gets multiple artillery units from elsewhere. This is one model to look at. Some resources (fighter aircraft) are available with a theatre command for training and familiarisation. The rest are with the air chief as reserves. If a theatre becomes the fulcrum of operations, then the air force chief deploys his reserves into it. All theatre commanders will initially report to the service chiefs. In the long run, when the forces are fully integrated, they will report to a CDS who has served in naval and air force billets.On joint training: Today, we are doing joint training at staff course level (Majors and equivalent) and at National Defence College level (Brigadiers and equivalent), but not at the higher command level (Colonels and equivalent). This is where we need to start training together to start understanding all the services well. I didn't know the capabilities of a Sukhoi till I became an army commander. I learned of the capabilities of a P-8I aircraft only when the navy offered it for a mission during Doklam (the standoff). We need to understand each other's platforms and capabilities. For instance, an AWACS is not just an eye in the sky, it also has ears and can locate an armoured division.On consulting the three Service chiefs about theatre commands: I have begun discussions with them but we are yet to have a formal sit down. In my mind, I'm very clear about what I want but I want to discuss it with them before I speak. They might have better ideas than me. If not, then what I have in mind will be what goes. The decision has to be taken by someone. As of now, we are reorganising the Department of Military Affairs.On the need to prioritise modernisation with existing budgets: Budget is more of a management issue than a funds issue. In the past three years, the army had deficiencies in modern equipment, ammunition and Married Accommodation Projects (MAPs). We gave weapons and ammunition higher priority. Now if we gave MAPs a higher priority, we would be in trouble. Buying whatever is available with the money you have in hand is not the way. You have to be serious about what you want, focus on it and then spend.On managing the pension burden: Jawans are being retired at the age of 37 and 38. After a hard life in service, they are left high and dry. We are considering increasing the retirement age to 58 in certain services-like giving them priority for reemployment in Defence Service Corps (static duties). One-third of the army can be retired at 58 years. We are presently giving them 30 years of pension for 17 years of service. Why not reverse it to 20 years of pension for 38 years of service? All services have been asked to submit their proposals to me by year-end.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " '\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n For Uddhav, it\\'s Mumbai Meri JaanA visible revamp of Shiv Sena stronghold Mumbai, decentralising power and making government accessible to the people top the Maharashtra chief minister’s governance agendaadvertisement\\n\\n\\n  Kiran D. Tare  Mumbai February 7, 2020 ISSUE DATE: February 17, 2020UPDATED: February 7, 2020 14:51 IST  People\\'s CM Uddav Thackeray at a Shiv Sena felicitation event in Mumbai (Photo: Mandar Deodhar)A fortnight after he took charge as Maharashtra chief minister on November 28 last year, Uddhav Thackeray told bureaucrats at a meeting in Mantralaya, the administrative headquarters of the state government, that he wanted to rid Mumbai of \"visual pollution\". As bureaucrats looked on, he explained that he abhorred the unplanned construction, poorly maintained structures and filth in the city, and wanted to spruce up Mumbai.Two months into office, as Thackeray begins to get a grip on the administration and outlines his vision for Maharashtra, a few things are clear: a revamp of Mumbai, stronghold of the Shiv Sena, will receive his special attention. The new chief minister is also keen to be seen as an accessible administrator.Political observers were puzzled when Thackeray agreed to give his allies, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress, the most plum portfolios. The Sena has direct control over only two major portfolios-urban development and agriculture. The rest, including home, finance, public works, revenue, power, water resources, education, health and tribal development, are with the allies.A Sena insider says Thackeray\\'s priority is to strengthen the party in Mumbai. In the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections due in February 2022, he wants the party to win over a hundred out of the 227 seats. With an annual budget of around Rs 25,000 crore, the BMC is the richest civic body in Asia. \"Two years may seem like a long period, but we want to focus on the BMC election from now,\" says the insider.Thackeray has made son and tourism minister Aaditya a \\'guardian minister\\' for the Mumbai Suburban district, though he was elected MLA from the Mumbai City district. In the BMC election held in 2017, the BJP had posed a big challenge to the Sena in Mumbai\\'s suburbs, bagging 82 seats, just two short of the Sena\\'s tally. As a guardian minister has authority to plan a district\\'s annual expenditure, Aaditya is expected to pump money into areas where the Sena hopes to reap benefits in the next BMC election. A planning meeting of the Mumbai Suburban district that Aaditya chaired on January 22 okayed development works for an estimated Rs 3,000 crore.The government\\'s key initiatives in Mumbai include segregation of waste, planting 400,000 saplings of Indian origin in 65 areas, revival of the \\'Mumbai Eye\\' project on the lines of the London Eye, and a Rs 100 crore industrial training institute.According to the Sena insider, Thackeray wants to showcase \"constructive work\" in a bid to placate a wide section of party sympathisers who are upset with him for joining hands with the Congress and NCP and veering off the Hindutva agenda. \"Thackeray gave the NCP and the Congress an upper hand in government as part of a conscious strategy. He wanted the government to be stable so that he can focus on his priorities,\" says the insider.Congress legislator Anant Gadgil says the Congress should learn from the Sena and give priority to the urban areas, where it has been losing support.Thackeray has also mounted a public relations exercise to project himself as a people\\'s leader. Once a week, he meets commoners at the Mantralaya, hearing out their grievances. He called over a 21-year-old Dombivali student who sells peanuts, and assured him of financial assistance for his education. \"The chief minister has instructed us to read each and every letter to the editor published in local newspapers and report to him about public opinion and complaints,\" says an official in Thackeray\\'s office.Thackeray has initiated various reforms to decentralise power. Within a month of the announcement on December 21, chief minister\\'s sub-offices have been set up at each of the six revenue headquarters, where officials receive public complaints and forward them to respective departments. \"I do not want people to travel all the way to Mumbai for problems that can be solved locally,\" Thackeray has said. Agriculture assistance centres have come up in all 36 districts of the state. The chief minister has, on similar lines, mooted disaster management cells in each district.Sources say Thackeray has conveyed to his ministers that he will not interfere in their departments\\' day-to-day work unless it is a policy matter. In his very first meeting with bureaucrats, he made it clear that he will sign a file only after the chief secretary clears it and that no minister or bureaucrat should approach him directly bypassing set protocol and procedure. A senior bureaucrat sees Thackeray as a quick learner. \"We were sceptical at first as he used to step into office only towards the afternoon. But he has moulded himself and is showing interest in administration,\" he says. A Congress leader, however, argues that Thackeray\\'s approach will give the bureaucracy too much power and reduce ministers to rubber stamps.So far, Thackeray has managed to keep relations between the allies fairly smooth, stepping in, if need be, to douse fires. When Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut claimed that former prime minister Indira Gandhi used to visit underworld don Karim Lala in Mumbai, Thackeray got Aaditya to pacify Congress leaders. Aaditya called on Raut and conveyed to him that Thackeray wanted him to issue a quick clarification that he had great respect for the late leader. \"One does not need to give history references all the time,\" Aaditya also said, in a public snub to Raut.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " '\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n Nitish Keeps Big Brother BJP GuessingAfter voicing his disapproval of a countrywide NRC, the Bihar chief minister now wants the contentious new questions in the forthcoming NPR dropped.advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Amitabh Srivastava    February 7, 2020 ISSUE DATE: February 17, 2020UPDATED: February 7, 2020 14:51 IST  Friends in need: Nitish Kumar with the BJP’s Sushil Modi at an event in Patna (Photo: Sonu Kishan)Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, who has allowed himself a delicate ambivalence on the controversial CAA (Citizenship (Amendment) Act) but sounded quite categorical in his rejection of the proposed NRC (National Register of Citizens) has now demanded that the additional questions introduced in the upcoming National Population Register (NPR) exercise be dropped and the survey conducted as per the existing format.\"Even I will not be able to answer if you ask me my mother\\'s date of birth,\" Nitish told mediapersons in Patna on January 28. \"In earlier times, people from rural backgrounds did not keep a note of such details. There could still be a large number of poor people who do not know their parents\\' date and place of birth.\"The new NPR exercise, scheduled this year, has 21 questions, six more than in the last such exercise in 2010. Some of the new questions, such as the place and date of birth of parents, have triggered a political storm, with opposition parties claiming the Modi government seeks these additional details for potential exclusionary use in the NRC to be compiled at a later date.In Bihar, the NPR is likely to begin in May, just four months before the assembly election. While respondents have the option of not answering some of the questions-in which case, the enumerator will mark them with a dash-there is speculation that blank responses may go against individuals during the NRC. \"We want the Centre to revert to the old NPR format to eliminate speculation among people,\" says a leader of the Janata Dal-United or JD(U).With 16 Lok Sabha MPs, the JD(U) is the sec\\xadond largest constituent of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). The party had voted in favour of the CAA in Parliament last December. Thereafter, however, Nitish has signalled that his support cannot be taken for granted. He rejected the NRC on January 13-and has now gone public with his position on the NPR.Nitish\\'s NPR demand came the very day he iss\\xadued a warning to JD(U) vice-president Prashant Kishor and veteran Pavan K. Varma over their public criticism of the CAA. Kishor and Varma were expelled from the JD(U) the next day. The two developments should not be seen in isolation. \"Prashant Kishor has been an ace campaign strategist. There is a distinct possibility that he may now team up with the opposition for the Bihar assembly poll. So we cannot leave our position on crucial issues vague and allow our opponents to exploit it,\" says the JD(U) leader.Kishor, after his expulsion, tweeted his gratitude to Nitish and extended his best wishes for retaining the chief ministerial chair. Many in the JD(U) see it as a sarcastic jibe and do not rule out Kishor mounting a challenge against the party in the assembly poll. \"We are ready. Let Kishor make his intentions clear after the Delhi election,\" says another JD(U) leader.Bihar\\'s parties are already warming up for the state poll. Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav is likely to launch his Berozgari Hatao (Remove Unemployment) Yatra whereas the Samvidhan Bachao (Save the Constitution) Yatra announced by Communist Party of India (CPI) leader Kanhaiya Kumar against the CAA is under way. Nitish has held consultations with his party members in January. The JD(U) is focusing on stepping up preparedness at the booth level.Home minister Amit Shah has announced that Nitish will lead the NDA campaign in the Bihar assembly election. Having won 39 of the 40 seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the alliance holds a psychological edge against the conglomeration of opposition parties. A senior JD(U) leader, however, told India Today that though the opposition was decimated in the general election, the assembly contest may be far from one-sided. \"We are aware that efforts are being made to get Kanhaiya Kumar to join hands with Tejashwi. Unlike the Lok Sabha election, the opposition alliance may also take the left parties on board for the assembly poll. We cannot afford to be complacent,\" said the leader.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

On Friday, the Rajasthan High Court quashed the FIRs against main investor Navratan Kothari, ex-deputy election commissioner of India Vinod Zutshi, IAS officer Hridyesh Kumar and others for fraud and conspiracy in the award of the contract. Says Kothari, 78, who was arr\\xadested in the case once in 2013, \"At my age, all I wish is to give Jaipur a magnificent palace before I die, not make money....\"Located between the Amer Fort and the Pink City, the man-made lake built by Jaipur\\'s rulers between the 16th and 18th centuries, got entangled in the political tussle between Ashok Gehlot-then a Congress chief minister in his first tenure in 2000-and his successor from the BJP, Vasundhara Raje. The Gehlot government finalised the bids just before the poll results came out in December 2003 and Raje gave it the go-ahead in February 2004. Subsequ\\xadently, though, she did an about-turn. A series of cases were filed at various stages, with Gehlot failing to get it completed even during his second tenure (2008-13) and Raje failing to get it cancelled it in her term (2013-18).KGK Enterprises, a consortium of companies, had won the award for cleaning and maintaining the lake, restoring and renovating the palace and building two hotels and a handicrafts bazaar. While Jaipur-based jeweller and real estate baron Kothari is the patriarch, some of the other companies in the consortium had links to Mofatraj Munot, owner of the Mumbai-based Rs 5,000 crore Kalpataru group. Given Munot\\'s family ties with Gehlot, the BJP cried favouritism in the award of contracts. The allegations included handing over of land worth Rs 3,500 crore, waiving of Rs 65 crore stamp duty and making changes in the project design. Kothari told india today that all the charges were false and that he never intended to exceed the construction beyond the approved 13 per cent of the total land area.The courts also gave inconsistent verd\\xadicts over the years in different cases. As the high court said in its latest judgment, in 2010, one magistrate ordered an FIR after three different investigating officers had concluded that no offence was committed. Meanwhile, KGK renovated and restored the lake where sewage of the city was dumped, and took up other work on the palace and setting up of decantation tanks to clean sewage. But the high court, responding to a PIL, stayed the works in 2011 and, a year later, struck down the project. Meanwhile, the apex court upheld the contract in 2014 but in another judgment refused to quash the FIR from 2010. The Raje government, then, tried to get the lake declared a protected area in 2015, but the KGK group got a status quo order against it in court.Kothari, who says he has already spent Rs 150 crore on the project, says he will now move the apex court to get a status quo order on his contempt plea removed following quashing of the criminal case. Ajay Kumar Jain, the lawyer who has been pursuing various cases including the one that the high court decided, says he too will move the apex court against the quashing of the FIR.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " '\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n The Gloves are Off| DelhiIn the final stages of campaigning, the BJP has changed both its mascot and its promises; it now sees less purchase in the promise of better governanceadvertisement\\n\\n\\n  Gulam Jeelani    January 31, 2020 ISSUE DATE: February 10, 2020UPDATED: January 31, 2020 14:12 IST  FRONTAL ASSAULT: Amit Shah with Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari (right) at a campaign rally. (Photo: ANI)Addressing back-to-back ral\\xadl\\xad\\xadies in Delhi\\'s Rithala and Janakpuri areas on January 27, Union home minister Amit Shah asked Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal if he was in favour of arresting Sharjeel Imam, the student-activist facing sedition charges in five states over his controversial remarks at Aligarh Muslim University (a rambling speech during which he took potshots at the Left and the Right and then sug\\xadgested a blockade to cut off the Northeast to protest the condition of Muslims there). \"Kejriwalji, are you in favour of action against Sharjeel Imam or not? Make it clear to the people of Delhi,\" Shah said in one of his speeches.Within minutes, Kejriwal took to Twitter and asked what was stopping Shah from arresting Sharjeel. \"...or do you have to do more dirty politics now\" the Delhi CM tweeted. The trading of charges and the verbal sparring between Shah and Kejriwal have visibly escalated in the last leg of campaigning for the Delhi assembly election.With less than ten days to go for the February 8 polls, the BJP, which is yet to announce a chief ministerial candidate, has put all its might behind a late tactical manoeuvre to make Shah\\'s hard line on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 or CAA -- and Kejriwal\\'s ambivalence on the subject -- a pivot of their campaign. This marks a clear departure from its earlier strategy, where the BJP, which has been out of power in Delhi for more than two decades, was banking on Prime Minister Narendra Modi\\'s outsized image to put it past Kejriwal who is seeking a third term after a curtailed 49 days in office and the landslide win in 2015 (67 out of 70 seats). In the last week of December, days before election dates were announced, the BJP\\'s Delhi unit had launched a massive publicity drive to highlight the Modi government\\'s decision to regularise unauthorised colonies. It put up thousands of hoardings in these settlements, which have some 4 million residents, flashing the promise and the PM\\'s face as a tacit endorsement of it. Modi had also launched the BJP\\'s campaign with a rally in Ramlila Maidan in December.But things started changing on the ground on January 23, with Shah hitting the campaign trail. As many as 343 public meetings were held on January 25 and another 250 on January 26. In the first three days, Shah was part of 11 poll-related programmes, including nukkad sabhas (street corner meetings). Taking over from Modi as the face of the BJP\\'s campaign, which had by now assumed an openly communal and vitriolic character (BJP MP from West Delhi, Parvesh Verma, was talking of how the Shaheen Bagh protesters would \"enter your houses, rape your sisters and daughters, and kill them\"), Shah, in rally after rally, accused Kejriwal of misleading the people of Delhi, claiming AAP\\'s promises of free wi-fi and quality education was all hogwash.Kejriwal, who had carefully avoided any anti-Modi rhetoric and chosen to focus on his governance plank, released a video message on January 26 asking Shah to stop humiliating the people of Delhi. \"For the last few days, Amit Shahji has been coming here to campaign daily and insult the people of Delhi. This is not right. In the past five years, the people of Delhi have worked very hard to improve our city,\" the chief minister said in the video. Political analyst Sanjay Kumar of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) says the BJP\\'s decision to now foreground Shah is a deliberate strategy to shield PM Modi. \"The BJP has changed its campaign style. They have moved from Modi to Shah as far as state elections are concerned,\" says Kumar. (A BJP leader who did not want to be named said Modi might address a rally or two in the first week of February after the budget session is over.)At the time of going to press, it looked like the BJP\\'s poll campaign was no longer centred on governance promises, but rather on issues such as the scrapping of Article 370 in J&K, triple talaq and the CAA, all of which have a certain communal flavour. \"The BJP has gone back to the basics, furthering its larger narrative of nationalism. If the polls get any more polarised in the days to come, it will damage AAP,\" says Kumar.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " '\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n Clouds Over the House of Badals| PunjabIn its 100th year, the Shiromani Akali Dal is facing a battle for survival, with the Badal family losing its grip on the party.advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Anilesh S. Mahajan  January 31, 2020 ISSUE DATE: February 10, 2020UPDATED: January 31, 2020 13:46 IST  CHANGE OF GUARD: Parkash Singh Badal (left) with son Sukhbir. (Photo: Prabhjot Bill)On January 18, rebelling Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leaders met at Delhi\\'s Constitution Club to stitch together a coalition to challenge Sukhbir Badal\\'s leadership of the party. They had already identified SAD\\'s Rajya Sabha MP, Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, to anchor this coalition. Sukhdev, who for three decades had occupied the position of party secretary general, resigned in October last year from the leadership of the SAD in the Rajya Sabha. Soon after, his son, Parminder Singh Dhindsa, gave up his post as chief of the party unit in the Punjab assembly.Politically, the SAD has been struggling to enthuse its core base -- panthic voters, who are more alive to issues relating to the Sikh faith. Badal\\'s rivals have accused the party of mishandling the fallout of the June 2015 desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib. There were public protests and the police had opened fire on protesters in Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan in Faridkot. Punjab was governed by a BJP-SAD coalition at the time.Speaking to India Today, Sukhbir insists that, politically speaking, the worst was over for the SAD, though many of his party colleagues disagree. To illustrate, they point out that in mid-January, similar unrest was witnessed when PTC Punjabi, a TV channel owned by the Badals, claimed intellectual property rights over the daily hukamnama telecast from the Golden Temple. This really angered the Sikh community. \"The SAD cannot afford another religious controversy,\" points out an Akali Dal legislator. With the assembly election just two years away, the party needs to plan its revival strategy soon, or risk giving ally BJP more bargaining power and, worse, strengthening the hand of the ruling Congress.Sukhbir is aware that recent events have made reviving the party\\'s fortunes more difficult. His father, five-time Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, now 92, has been staying away from public appearances. Other challenges include former party stalwarts Ranjit Singh Brahmpura, Rattan Singh Ajnala and Sewa Singh Sekhwan, who, following their sacking from the SAD in late 2018, formed the Shiromani Akali Dal (Taksali) in December the same year. These leaders have influence with voters in the Majha region-which consists of the Gurdaspur, Amritsar and Tarn Taran districts in northwest Punjab. Worse, leaders of other Akali factions-such as Paramjit Singh Sarna, Manjit Singh G.K. and Ravi Inder Singh-appear to be aligning themselves with the Dhindsas. Sukhbir argues that these leaders don\\'t have mass appeal, but they are pulling away, and it could only weaken the party.Sukhbir Badal is aware that the exit of top SAD leaders has made the task of reviving the party much more difficult.In the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the SAD managed to win just two seats -- Ferozepur and Bathinda, won by Sukhbir and his wife, Harsimrat Kaur Badal, respectively -- despite a slight uptick in its overall vote share from 26.3 per cent to 27.5 per cent. What is especially worrying is that apart from these seats, the SAD was not a major contender in the state\\'s Malwa region, which accounts for 69 seats in the 117-seat assembly. While Sukhdev Dhindsa might not have a huge voter base around his pocket borough in Sangrur (in the Malwa belt), his exit will complicate matters. His understanding of religious issues made him indispensable to the SAD and his exit will mean a longer recovery period for the party among panthic voters in the region.Sukhbir disagrees with that assessmen -- but according to Parminder Dhindsa, \"that is exactly the problem.\" Sukhdev Dhindsa elaborates: \"I requested SAD leaders to offer an apology to the Akal Takht. Initially, they agreed, but they eventually did not go.\" Parminder says: \"It would not have been an admission of guilt, but would have pacified the agitators.\"Worse, the SAD\\'s allies may also be looking to profit from its troubles. On January 17, at an event in Jalandhar to elect new state BJP chief Ashwani Sharma, many leaders spoke of abandoning the BJP-SAD alliance. Although the party leadership is treading cautiously on the issue of abandoning an ally of two decades, especially given the recent split between the BJP and its allies in Maharashtra and Jharkhand, this will not prevent BJP leaders from opening channels with the new Akali Dal (Taksali).For over two decades, thanks to its strength in the state, the SAD managed to retain a leadership position in its alliance with the BJP. However, BJP leaders believe that recent results -- such as the increase in the alliance\\'s vote share in the 2019 Lok Sabha election -- are a result of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\\'s popularity. This could encourage new alliances -- such as with the Dhindsa-led Akali Dal (Taksali). The first overtures in this regard appear to have come from the Centre. In January 2019, the Union government honoured Sukhdev Dhindsa with the Padma Bhushan -- and in his bid to stitch together a new alliance, Dhindsa has avoided taking potshots at the BJP while training his fire on the Badals. Further, on January 20, the BJP snapped ties with the SAD for the Delhi election, and is in touch with the rebels for support in the assembly poll.Dhindsa\\'s new status as an opposition leader close to the BJP could also upset the Badal family\\'s fortunes when it comes to the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee. Elections to this body, which administers gurudwaras in Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, including the Golden Temple, have been due since 2016, with the Amit Shah-led home ministry yet to decide on a date.For the moment, the BJP appears happy to wait for the Dhindsas to build a new Akali Dal and attract panthic votes. The BJP has frequently used a combination of such voters with its own base to win key urban centres such as Jalandhar, Bathinda, Patiala and Ludhiana. \"We can do it for the new [breakaway] Akali Dal as well,\" says a top BJP leader.Sukhbir dismisses the conjecture. \"We have clear alliance terms,\" he says. \"They know their 23 assembly seats, we have our 94. Similarly, we have a 10-3 arrangement for the general election. This will continue.\"Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?    Awesome!

(Photo: Sonu Kishan)It\\'s an election year and Nitish Kumar knows it well. He sounded conciliatory on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, when senior leaders of his party, the JD(U), Prashant Kishor and Pavan K. Varma, went public with their criticism of the new law but seems to have changed his line after Union home minister Amit Shah paid a visit and declared that Nitish would lead the BJP-JD(U) all\\xadiance in the state election. Likely emboldened by Shah\\'s vote of confid\\xadence, Nitish has ticked off both Kishor and Varma in no uncertain terms, saying they are \"free to leave\" if they want.Speaking in Vaishali dist\\xadrict, Shah, till recently the BJP national president, said he was there to scotch \"all rumours\". \"The NDA will contest the next Bihar poll under Nitishji\\'s leadership. The BJP-JD(U) alliance is unbreakable,\" he said. Shah\\'s statement should silence the handful of state leaders pressing the BJP to stake its claim to the chief minister\\'s post.Just three days before Shah\\'s Bihar visit, Nitish had categorically rejected the need for a National Register of Cit\\xadi\\xadzens (NRC)-of which Shah has been the mascot and most vocal advocate -- and expressed a willingness to have an open debate on the CAA. Many BJP hawks had taken umbrage, and a strong response was expected from Shah. That the usually bellicose Shah let it slide is being seen as a sign of his reluctance to disturb a winning combination.Having recently burnt its fingers in Maharashtra and Jharkhand, the BJP leadership is clearly not up to dealing with another warring ally in another big state; Bihar sends up 40 MPs to the Lok Sabha. Elections are just 10 months away and as a JD(U) leader, who preferred to stay anonymous, says, \"The BJP needs to und\\xaderstand that Nitish, at 68, may be seeking his last term as chief minister. State BJP leaders must have patience and back him.\"8.9 million Votes JD(U) polled in the 2019 general election, a 38.7% jump from its tally in the 2015 assembly pollA deep scrutiny of the 2019 Lok Sabha poll results reveals that the BJP, despite the tally of 17 seats and 9.6 million votes (of the total 40 million), was still not the biggest gainer in the state; Nitish\\'s JD(U), with nearly 9 million votes, was. The BJP got 9.3 million votes in the 2015 state assembly poll which it lost to the RJD-JD(U) alliance. The BJP\\'s 2019 LS vote figures recorded an increase of 310,000 votes. Nitish\\'s JD(U) bagged over 8.9 million votes, an astounding 38.7 per cent leap over its 2015 figures.Bihar has added 6.1 million new voters since the 2014 Lok Sabha election, and the JD(U) leadership believes every second new voter voted for Nitish, one reason why it\\'s not looking for new alliances. \"We cannot be part of a \\'tainted\\' alliance (a reference to RJD leader Lalu Prasad Yadav\\'s conviction in the fodder scam),\" says a JD(U) leader. \"Young voters may not take too kindly to it.\"A section of JD(U) leaders, however, are apprehensive about seat distribution. In the 2010 assembly poll, which Nitish contested in alliance with the BJP, the JD(U) had fielded candidates in 141 seats to the saffron party\\'s 102. In the 2019 general election, the two parties contested an equal number of seats. More importantly, the results -- the BJP won all 17 that it contested -- have apparently put it on an even keel with the JD(U). Seat negotiations are sure to start with the BJP demanding a far bigger share than in 2010. But as the JD(U) leader puts it, \"State elections are all about electing a chief minister.\" And here the party is sure it holds the trump card.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " '\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n Politics Over Pension| ChhattisgarhThe BJP cries foul as the Baghel government scraps a rule granting pension to Emergency-era detainees.advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Rahul Noronha  January 31, 2020 ISSUE DATE: February 10, 2020UPDATED: January 31, 2020 13:46 IST  IN THE EYE OF A STORM: Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel at an event in Bastar.The Congress government in Chhattisgarh has scrapped a 2008 rule that entitles a monthly pension to those detained during the Emergency (1975-77) under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA) and Defence of India Rules (DIR). While the opposition BJP has criticised the move as anti-democratic, Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel says the pension funds will be channelled into development work.The Baghel government\\'s decision comes within weeks of over a hundred beneficiaries of the scheme securing a verdict from the Chhattisgarh High Court for resumption of their pension. The state government had suspended the payments in January last year, calling it political largesse by the Raman Singh-led BJP administration, and ordered a verification of all beneficiaries. The high court struck down the suspension in December.When enacted in 2008, the Loknayak Jaiprakash Narayan (MISA and DIR Detainees) Samman Nidhi Rule provided for a monthly pension of Rs 3,000 for those incarcerated during the Emergency for less than six months. Those who spent more than six months in jail were eligible for Rs 6,000 a month. By 2017, the pension had been revised to Rs 25,000 per month for the 320 beneficiaries, most of whom come from BJP ranks. The scheme costs the state exchequer Rs 9.6 crore annually.Last year, neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, also ruled by the Congress, had suspended a similar pension scheme at around the same time, only to resume it within two months after a verification of the beneficiaries. An estimated 2,000 people receive the pension in MP. Among them are top BJP leaders, such as former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and former ministers Sartaj Singh and Ajay Vishnoi. The state government spends about Rs 60 crore annually on the pension scheme.Rs 9.6 crore Annual cost incurred by the Chhattisgarh government on the pension schemeChhattisgarh advocate general Satish Chandra Verma defends the Baghel government\\'s decision. \"The detentions made [during the Emergency] were as per the prevailing laws. These detainees are not freedom fighters. If they are honoured for breaking the law, governance is bound to suffer.\"BJP state vice-president Sachidanand Upasane, however, decried the move as an insult to those who had stood up to uphold democracy during the Emergency. \"The Congress government in Chhattisgarh has been against this pension from the beginning. Its decision smacks of vendetta and is also in contempt of court. We will challenge it legally,\" said Upasane, who is also national vice-president of the Loktantra Senani Sangh, an outfit whose members include political detainees from the Emergency period.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " '\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n Who\\'s the Real Boss?The Maharashtra deputy chief minister\\'s assertiveness has raised eyebrows.advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Kiran D. Tare  January 24, 2020 ISSUE DATE: February 3, 2020UPDATED: January 24, 2020 15:46 IST  PAWAR PLAY Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar (Photo credit: MANDAR DEODHAR)Soon after assuming office as Maharashtra deputy chief minister on December 30, 2019, Ajit Pawar demanded that his allotted office in Mantralaya be changed. The cabin he had been assigned, #602, is considered \\'inauspicious\\'. Three former occupants-Eknath Khadse, Pandurang Fundkar and Anil Bonde-have suffered political setbacks as incumbents. (However, Pawar brushed aside the suggestion that he was being superstitious, saying, \"I chose another cabin [to be closer] to the chief secretary\\'s-if the chief minister calls a meeting, it\\'ll be more convenient for me to attend.\")Pawar looks to be attempting an image makeover to establish himself as an inclusive leader and stern administrator. On the first count, on January 1, despite being an advocate of Maratha dominance, Pawar made a point to travel to Koregaon-Bhima to pay homage to Dalit soldiers on the anniversary of that conflict. The next day, he visited the site of the memorial to Dalit icon B.R. Ambedkar to review the progress of the construction work.And on January 16, flexing his political muscle, Pawar had close confidant and social justice minister Dhananjay Munde, involved in the monitoring of that project. Until then, the Rs 3,000 crore project had been the sole responsibility of a department overseen by the urban development minister, Shiv Sena\\'s Eknath Shinde. \\'The design of the memorial is ready. The social justice department will monitor the progress,\\' read a press release.Other unilateral decisions by Pawar have also caught bureaucrats and alliance partners by surprise. This included an announcement that Marathi would likely be made compulsory in schools until class 10 (leaving the minister for school education, Congress\\'s Varsha Gaikwad, in the dark) and a decision to rename Mumbai\\'s eastern freeway after a former CM, the late Vilasrao Deshmukh (going against Shinde\\'s wishes). In a similar vein, on January 17, Pawar announced that a section of the Pune Metro would be renamed the Pune-Pimpri-Chinchwad Metro.Political observers say these moves are Pawar\\'s bid to establish dominance in the government, to stay ahead of party rivals Jayant Patil, Chhagan Bhujbal, Dilip Walse-Patil and Hassan Mushrif, all of whom are ministers. Some say he is, in fact, trying to upstage the \\'inexperienced\\' chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. One such attempt met resistance: on January 16, in his capacity as finance minister, Pawar announced Rs 46 crore in aid for Mumbai\\'s Bai Jerbai Wadia children\\'s hospital, which is facing a financial crisis. Hours later, Thackeray had the sum reduced to Rs 24 crore.Chief Minister Thackeray has, so far, allowed Pawar a free hand, with an official from his office saying the CM is keen to maintain harmony in the cabinet. But this could change if Pawar continues to push the limits of his authority. An official from Pawar\\'s office says he is currently reviewing all government departments as he prepares the state\\'s budget, to be presented in the third week of February. Normally, finance ministers discuss each department\\'s financial requirements with the ministers concerned, but do not review the department\\'s work.Political analyst Hemant Desai points out Pawar has not hid his ambition to lead the state. \"It is clear he is trying to dominate,\" Desai says. Bearing this out, at a rally in Pune on January 19, Pawar compared himself with uncle and NCP supremo Sharad Pawar. \"If saheb (Sharad Pawar) can become CM four times, why can\\'t I become a deputy CM for an equal number?\" he asked. It will be interesting to see how the NCP chief takes this statement.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " '\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n Return of the rabble-rouserIn retaining Dilip Ghosh as head of the state BJP, the party has signalled its intention to run a polarising election campaign in the state.advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Romita Datta  January 24, 2020 ISSUE DATE: February 3, 2020UPDATED: January 24, 2020 15:45 IST  PARTY MASCOT The Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh looks the part (Photo credit: SUBIR HALDER)If you thought Dilip Ghosh would pay the price for shooting off his mouth on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, think again. Ghosh, under whose watch the BJP notched a spectacular tally in the 2019 general election-18 of the state\\'s 42 seats and a 40 per cent vote share-was re-elected state BJP president on January 16.Ghosh was roundly criticised within his own party for first calling CAA protesters \"spineless devils and parasites\" and then asking for them to be \"shot like dogs\". The central leadership apparently cautioned him, the Union minister of state for environment, forests and climate change Babul Supriyo dissociated himself and his party from Ghosh\\'s comments while BJP state vice president Chandra Kumar Bose said \"terror politics has no place in the country\".In fact, it was Supriyo who was being projected as the probable face of the CAA campaign in Bengal, even though he too found himself mired in controversy when he criticised a student online for tearing a copy of the CAA at her convocation in Jadavpur University and then told an Indian Muslim who questioned his reaction that he\\'d give him the answer after he had been \"sent back to his own country\".Yet, the BJP leadership chose to repose their faith in Ghosh, who says that the prime minister and home minister may have \\'cautioned\\' him about his language but never \\'censured\\' him. Finally, Ghosh believes, he was able to convince home minister and BJP national president Amit Shah of the \"need to be aggressive\" in West Bengal. (See accompanying interview.)\"The party had long pondered his election, but there was no option at hand,\" says a senior party leader on condition of anonymity. What about Supriyo? \"Babul is not a man of politics on the ground,\" says the leader. As for other likely contenders for the post, the leader says, \"The party was sceptical about them as they had zero honesty and integrity as far as the party was concerned. At least this man (Ghosh) is 100 per cent committed to the party and its workers.\"\"The party is relying on combative people like Ghosh and Sayantan Bose to take on the aggressive style of functioning of TMC leaders,\" says Prasanto Roy, professor emeritus at Presidency University. By re-electing Ghosh to the top post in the state, Messrs Modi and Shah have endorsed his brand of politics to take on the TMC in the 2020 municipality and the 2021 assembly polls.Indeed, Ghosh\\'s language may be jarring to the Bengali bhadrolok, but it is considered useful to counter the muscle-flexing of Mamata\\'s men-be it Birbhum strongman Anubrata Mandal, who flashed his biceps and threatened to kill opponents, or leaders like Tapas Paul, who spoke of sending boys to rape women who were not with the party. \"The expectation of the middle class,\" says Ray, \"that leaders will speak a refined language has faded. Obscenities have become commonplace over the past two decades or so. Anil Basu and Benoy Kongar of the Left made personal attacks on Mamata in the foulest language.\" Ghosh has been raised in that tradition.His approach has traction in rural Bengal, where he is seen as a gutsy challenger to the TMC. With a vermilion tika on his forehead, saffron/ yellow attire and blatantly communal speech, Ghosh is the ideal mascot for the BJP in Bengal. In response to Mamata\\'s street processions against the CAA, Ghosh is organising abhinandan jatras-BJP worker-processions across the state, ostensibly to canvass support for the CAA, but, in fact, a barely disguised attempt to consolidate the Hindu vote.He is taking the job of polarising Hindus quite seriously, as mandated by his bosses in Delhi. \"This was the only way the BJP could make inroads in Bengal, where appeasement politics over several decades has given rise to feelings of neglect among a section of Hindus. The BJP cleverly used a space left unattended by political parties over time,\" says Sovon Lal Datta Gupta, former political science professor at Calcutta University.Little wonder, then, that Ghosh was elected unanimously by the state committee-there was no other nomination for the post. \"What clinched the deal for Dilipda,\" says Union MoS for Women and Child Development Debasree Chaudhuri, \"is his acceptance among party workers... [and] they found in him a state president fully commit ted to the party\\'s cause.\"Interview: Dilip Ghosh\\'Amit Shah understands the need to be aggressive in Bengal\\'Q. Having been labelled a \\'foul-mouthed\\' politician, how credible will you be as the face of the BJP?Only the media and a few people (intellectuals and bhadrolok) think I am foul-mouthed. Ask those on the ground. \"Go on, dada,\" they say, \"we are with you.\"Q. But how can you justify saying CAA protesters should be shot like dogs?What about the actions of others (Mamata, Buddhababu and Jyoti Basu)-the killing of Kishenji in an encounter, of 11 Gorkhas during the Darjeeling agitation, innocent farmers in Nandigram and immigrants at Marichjhapi?Q. The BJP has re-elected you as state president but seems reluctant to project you as its face in Bengal...In the BJP, the organisation is above the individual and collective leadership is important, whereas parties dependent on one personality (Mamata in Trinamool) or one family (Gandhis in Congress) have to lean on them as they have no options.Q. Word is the party is looking to get someone from outside to counter Mamata\\'s popularity?The party will not drop anyone from heaven. They will choose somebody who has been a product of the party.Q. How will you convince people of a unified BJP when your party leaders are criticising you publicly?Initially, Modiji cautioned me about my speeches. Now he too has realised this is how it should be. I told Amitji that if 92 of my party workers have been brutally killed, don\\'t expect me to go to Belur Math and meditate. Now, even he has understood the need to be aggressive in Bengal.Q. The Left alleges a Modi-Didi understanding, given the slow investigation in the Narada-Saradha scams.What harm will busting the Narada and Saradha scams do to Trinamool? The party won in 2016 because people were not concerned about money going into the pockets of leaders. They were getting rice at Rs 2 a kilo, a cycle for every household, student stipends, etc.Q. Is BJP feeling the heat of CAA and TMC protests?On the contrary, it has worked to our advantage. The CAA has resulted in a vertical split on the basis of religion. Hindus are polarised like never before.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?    Awesome!

Breakfast time at an anganwadi in Bhopal (Photo credit: PANKAJ TIWARI)A proposal to introduce egg in the menu of children and lactating mothers registered with the 97,135 anganwadis in Madhya Pradesh has run into a controversy. While the Kamal Nath government says eggs will help fight malnutrition, the opposition BJP terms it an assault on culture and an attempt to promote non-vegetarianism.The new meal menu is to be introduced in the next financial year, initially covering 89 of the 333 tribal blocks in the state. Children in the 1-6 age group and lactating mothers will get three eggs a week. The woman and child development department says introducing eggs in the 89 blocks will cost Rs 113 crore annually. Some 6.2 million children (up to the age of 6) and 700,000 lactating mothers are registered with the state\\'s anganwadis.While opposition leader Gopal Bhargava shocked everyone with his manifestly absurd claim that children eating eggs could \"turn cannibals\", some Jain and Vaishya groups, too, are upset. \"In Jainism, consuming egg amounts to jeev hatya (killing of animals). Introducing eggs when vegetarian protein options are available is inexplicable,\" says Pradeep Kasliwal, head of the Digambar Jain Social Group Federation, which has 60,000 members in eight states. The group has made representations to Nath and the governor.Taking on the egg naysayers, the Right to Food campaign has submitted to Nath 118,000 signatures, from 17 districts, in support of introducing eggs.Politics aside, the government\\'s intentions seem above board. According to the National Family Health Survey IV, released in 2016, MP was ranked third-last in the country in child nutrition (6 months to 6 years), with 43 per cent children underweight, 42 per cent stunted and 26 per cent affected by wasting or acute malnutrition. The proportion of underweight children was the highest among tribals (51.5 per cent), followed by Scheduled Castes (45.9 per cent). Among Hindus, it was 43 per cent, 39.9 per cent among Muslims and 18.7 per cent among Jains.But is introducing eggs enough to beat malnutrition? \"An analysis of the 2005-2016 period suggests it will take 50-60 years to wipe out malnutrition from MP. The interventions need to be scaled up,\" says Sachin Jain, director of voluntary group Vikas Samvad. If need be, a campaign will be run to help fund eggs in anganwadi menus, he adds.The state has offered to \\'compen\\xadsate\\' vegetarians with fruits like ban\\xad\\xadana. What\\'s good about eggs, experts argue, is that it is a nutrient-rich \\'sup\\xaderfood\\' that is easily available and ideal for rural areas that lack refrigerated storage. \"Also, there\\'s no resistance to our plan in the 89 tribal blocks,\" says Anupam Rajan, principal secretary, women and child development.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " '\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n Where is the Money? | MaharashtraCM Uddhav will struggle to raise funds for the farm loan waiver.advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Kiran D. Tare  Mumbai January 17, 2020 ISSUE DATE: January 27, 2020UPDATED: January 17, 2020 12:01 IST  PROMISES TO KEEP: CM Uddhav Thackeray. (Photo by: Mandar Deodhar)When Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced the waiver of all farm loans up to Rs 2 lakh on December 21, he was aware this would put a Rs 30,000 crore burden on the state exchequer. He has already written a letter to Prime Minister Nar\\xadendra Modi, urging him to release the state\\'s share of Rs 17,000 crore in Goods and Service Tax (GST) revenues.The loan waiver comes at a time when the state is reeling under a huge debt of Rs 4.71 lakh crore, 17 per cent of the state gross domestic product (SGDP), which is just six percentage points below the cap set by the RBI. A finance department note from December 2019 states that Maharashtra spends 59 per cent of its income on salaries, pension and interest on debt.As per government estimates, around 4 million farmers will benefit from the loan waiver. According to some estimates, the government will have to cut budgetary allocations of other departments by at least 20 per cent if it wants to implement the loan waiver. \"We are committed to making the farmers debt-free,\" says Thackeray. But an NCP minister says loan waivers are a cosmetic solution. He argues that if the crop loan scheme is effectively implemented, the farmers will require minimum loans. \"That can make a big difference.\" The state government spent Rs 2,095 crore as crop insurance premium this year (Rs 1,000 crore less than the target for 2019-20).The government\\'s ability to implement the farm loan waiver will depend on the state\\'s GST collections. This year, even though there is a jump in collections, it has not met targets till December-end. For Chief Minister Thackeray, this will be reason for worry.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Menon     Chennai January 17, 2020 ISSUE DATE: January 27, 2020UPDATED: January 17, 2020 12:00 IST  CONFIDENCE TRICK: DMK leader MK Stalin. (Photo by: Jaison G)If the December 2019 election to rural bodies is any indication, the ass\\xadembly election in 2021 holds uncertain prospects for both the ruling All-India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and its main rival, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). The DMK-led front, which won 38 of Tamil Nadu\\'s 39 Lok Sabha seats in 2019, retained its lead with a higher tally of wards in panchayat unions and district panchayats, but only just about.These are the first local body elections after the deaths of AIADMK and DMK titans J. Jayalalithaa and M. Karunanidhi, respectively. The DMK and its allies won 243 of the 513 district panchayat wards and bagged 2,099 seats in the panchayat union wards while the AIADMK won 214 district panchayat wards and 1,781 panchayat union seats. The BJP won seven district panchayat wards and 85 panchayat union wards.Around 77 per cent voters (nearly 20 million people) voted in 27 of Tamil Nadu\\'s 36 districts to elect representatives for village panchayats, panchayat unions and district panchayats. The verdict was near-even, with DMK and AIADMK getting a majority in 13 districts each, and Sivaganga giving both an equal number of seats. The Supreme Court has asked for delimitation of wards in five new districts and wants elections in all nine remaining districts in three months.The AIADMK seems to have regai\\xadned much of the support it lost during the parliamentary polls. The party held on to most of its traditional strongholds and retained the western zone, except the Nilgiris and Krishnagiri areas. Opp\\xadosition to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act may have influenced voters against the AIADMK. The DMK strengthened its position in the central region, making inroads even in Salem district, an AIADMK bastion, while holding on to its Tiruchirapalli, Tiruvarur and Thiruvannamalai bases.In response to state law minister D. Jayakumar dismissing his party as a waning moon, DMK president M.K. Stalin said, \"Our strength in the assembly has increased from 89 to 100. We had just 30 district panchayat councillors in 2011; now we have 243. I leave it to you to decide whether we are waning or waxing.\"But beyond the rhetoric, what does the outcome mean for the two parties? \"It exp\\xadoses the AIADMK\\'s declining rural base and the inability of the DMK leadership to translate the people\\'s discontent in its favour,\" says Ramu Manivannan, head of the department of politics and public administration, University of Madras. Both parties need to make course corrections and be wary of dark horses Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan. The filmstars-turned-politicians are looking to capitalise on the churn, counting specially on younger voters disillusioned by the two big Dravidian parties.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

(Photo: Getty Images)Union minister of state for environment, forests and climate change Babul Supriyo has been making news in West Bengal. Sources say Union home minister Amit Shah has singled out Supriyo to lead the party\\'s pro-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) campaign in the state. A BJP leader says, \"We need to project that we will push aggressively for the CAA. Who better to do it than Babul, who is fluent in Hindi and Bengali and has star appeal?\" Shah is also reportedly convinced that Supriyo\\'s aggression will be useful in countering anti-CAA sentiment.Supriyo\\'s aggression was on display in late December 2019. After a student graduating from Jadavpur University protested the CAA by tearing up a page from it at her convocation, Supriyo criticised her online, and was, in turn, questioned. Responding to a student named Mustafizur Rahman, Supriyo wrote that he would answer Rahman\\'s questions after he had been \\'sent back to his own country\\'. (Just to be clear, Rahman is an Indian Muslim.) However, the BJP\\'s state unit is reportedly sceptical of the plan, given the controversy in Supriyo\\'s wake and the friction between him and state BJP president Dilip Ghosh.15 Number of families BJP leaders are expected to meet every day for its CAA campaignGhosh is himself no stranger to aggression. At a rally in Rana-ghat on January 12, while talking about the destruction of public property in anti-CAA protests, Ghosh lauded the way some BJP state governments had come down on protesters. \"Just look at Assam, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka...our governments there killed those devils with bullets. They were killed like dogs,\" he was reported to have said. Those who damaged public property in West Bengal would be shot \"the same way\", he went on to say. Trying to distance himself and the party from Ghosh\\'s choice outburst, Supriyo tweeted it was a \\'very irresponsible\\' statement and \\'it is a figment of his imagination, BJP governments in UP and Assam have NEVER EVER resorted to shooting\\'. But Ghosh brushed aside the implied rebuke, saying: \"Such differences of opinion are okay in any party.\" Regarding Supriyo being chosen to lead the pro-CAA push, Ghosh notes that this template-an MP from the state serving as coordinator-is being used in other states as well.Other state leaders like to emphasise the BJP\\'s strength lies in its foot soldiers. \"More than 80,000 workshops have been conducted, in which workers have been trained on how to approach households and ensure registration for the CAA,\" says BJP leader Diptiman Sengupta. The party has undertaken a \\'ghar-ghar sampark\\' programme, tasking leaders with meeting between 15 and 40 families per day. Insisting on anonymity, a BJP general secretary from the state said Hindus will be told that the fight is for astitva (belonging), while for Muslims \"the onus will be on them to prove that they are citizens. If they stop us at the gate, it will mean they have something to hide. We have to convince them that holding back from registration would be disastrous because they would lose out on the benefit of public schemes. Even migration to other parts of the country for jobs will be difficult\".Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " '\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n Red Carpet for Industry | Madhya PradeshChief Minister Kamal Nath is making a big push to bring industry to his state.advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Rahul Noronha  Bhopal January 17, 2020 ISSUE DATE: January 27, 2020UPDATED: January 17, 2020 11:59 IST  A SURE HAND: CM Kamal Nath inaugurates the Magnificent MP meet as industry titans look on. (Photo: Mujeen Faruqui)As Chief Minister Kamal Nath undertakes his annual pilgrimage to the World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting at Davos from January 20, the big challenge before him will be to get business for the state. While Madhya Pradesh is primarily an agrarian state, there is now a fairly broad-based consensus that the state must outgrow its dependence on agriculture and build capabilities in manufacturing and services. Nath has been trying to drive that change since he took over in December 2018, and policy changes and legislative support have begun to slowly make a difference. Early on, his government saw the need to ease land acquisition and building laws. Circle rates were slashed by 20 per cent, and the number of documents required to get building permissions and layouts, from 27 to five. \"Colonisers can begin work and don\\'t need permission. We will check for compliances after three years,\" said Nath at Magnificent Madhya Pradesh, the state\\'s business meet in October 2019.In the post-GST era, MP has a strategic locational advantage. \"MP shares its borders with five states...a population of nearly 500 million can be acc\\xadessed from here,\" says state chief secretary S.R. Mohanty. Under a separate policy for warehousing and logistics, the state is offering investment assistance of up to Rs 15 crore on plant and machinery, stamp duty exemption and an increased floor area ratio (FAR). Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is setting up its nat\\xadional distribution centres here. \"Reliance will use 10 million sq. ft of space at 45 locations,\" RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani announced at the Magnificent MP event. \"Walmart, Reliance and Amazon too have expressed interest in building logistic hubs and warehouses in the state,\" says Rajesh Rajora, principal secretary, in the department of industrial policy and investment promotion.The state has also tweaked its industrial pro\\xadmotion policy. Prominent amendments include enhancing the investment promotion assistance cap from Rs 150 crore to Rs 200 crore, and an incentive of up to Rs 1 crore, or 50 per cent of the cost, to set up waste management, pollution, safety and water conservation equipment at plants.64 large units set up in past year; rs 7,188 crore aggregate investment; 22,000 jobs createdSince employment-intensive sectors are a focus, tourism has been singled out for support. A capital investment subsidy of 15-30 per cent has been introduced for tourism projects, and a 40 per cent subsidy for ropeways and inaccessible tourist and forest areas. Efforts are also on to enhance the carrying capacity of tiger reserves to capitalise on tiger tourism in the state.The state government has come up with a land pooling pol\\xadicy where landowners willingly give up their small parcels of land for the greater economies of scale. An MP Time Bound Clearances Bill has been passed for business applications. A similar law is on the cards for the services sector.According to data put out by the Madhya Pradesh Industries Development Corporation, 64 large-scale industrial units-with aggregate investments of Rs 7,188 crore-have been set up/ exp\\xadanded operations in the state in the past year, creating over 22,000 jobs. Additionally, 545 investment proposals worth Rs 31,425 crore have been cleared through the single window sys\\xadtem.Initial successes notwithsta\\xadn\\xadding, challenges remain. The notorious bureaucracy in the state, general economic sentiment and a stuttering agriculture sector top the list. An excessive monsoon took a toll on crops, and suppre\\xadssed export prices of premium products such as basmati paddy hit farm incomes. The state\\'s financial condition is also cause for concern. It will take two years for the changes Nath has made to take effect, say analysts.

       " '\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n A Turn in the Tide | BiharNitish Kumar’s Bihar becomes the first state run by a BJP ally to take a stand against CAA/ NRC.advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Amitabh Srivastava    Patna January 17, 2020 ISSUE DATE: January 27, 2020UPDATED: January 17, 2020 11:58 IST  Change of Heart? Bihar CM Nitish Kumar. (Photo: ANI)Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has finally come out and said \"there is no question of implementing the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Bihar\". After supporting the passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019 in Parliament, Nitish now says he is open to a debate on the controversial religion-based citizenship law.The chief minister, in a statement in the assembly on January 13, said, \"I have no objection to a detailed debate on the CAA. If the people want it, we can have a discussion in the house. As for the NRC, there is no justification for it.\" He also said the NRC was envisaged in the context of Ass\\xadam, and not the entire country. With this, the JD(U) becomes the third BJP ally-they share power in Bihar-to opp\\xadose the NRC, which many believe is next on the party agenda after the CAA and the National Population Register (NPR).This comes as bad news for the BJP. On January 16, Union home minister and party president Amit Shah is to address a public meeting in Bihar\\'s Vaishali district to drum up support for the contentious citizenship law. The state is set for the assembly election in November this year, so Kumar\\'s remark assumes crucial significance. By calling for a discussion on the CAA, he has not just expressed a need for a rethink, he has , in fact, questioned the justification for the new citizenship law. His latest statements are also seen as an attempt to harmonise the conflicting stands taken inside the JD(U) itself. Two prominent leaders, Pavan K. Varma and Prashant Kishor, who openly opposed the CAA and NRC, were heckled by other leaders.\"I have complete faith in Nitishji\\'s secular credentials and I totally believe that he cannot support any religiously exclusive citizenship law,\" Varma had said then. He made a fresh pitch after BJP leader and Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi recently announced the dates for collection of data for the NPR. JD(U) insiders say Varma has overlooked the Bihar government\\'s December 18 notification for the NPR exercise in the state. The notification was published in a gazette on January 3. Poll strategist Kishor, who has also been vocal in his opposition to the CAA and the NRC, had called on Kumar last month to discuss the issue.Nitish\\'s ambivalence on CAA will embarrass ally BJP, but it is a calculated gamble in an election yearJD(U) spokesperson K.C. Tyagi, meanwhile, says the NPR must not be confused with the NRC. \"NPR was introduced during the UPA regime. Now that the prime minister has clarified that there will be no NRC, there is no problem going ahead with the NPR,\" he said.The NPR is a register of the country\\'s \\'usual residents\\'. The rules make it mandatory for every resident to register for this. The new population register has triggered a controversy as it will include questions on date and place of birth of parents, as also their last place of residence. While clarifying his party\\'s (new) stand on the CAA-NRC, Kumar also made a case for releasing caste data collected in the Census exercise. He has long been insisting that the Centre release this data, arguing that without it, various castes give their own statistics and claim under-representation in government. The demand is also a ploy to win over formidable vote banks in an election year.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " '\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n Failing our children, againThe spate of neonatal deaths at Kota\\'s Jay Kay Lon Hospital is an all-too-familiar tale of shoddy infrastructure, staff shortage, poor hygiene.advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Rohit Parihar  Kota January 10, 2020 ISSUE DATE: January 20, 2020UPDATED: January 10, 2020 15:49 IST  (Photo: Purushottam Diwakar)The deaths of 112 babies (December 1 to January 6) at Kota\\'s Jay Kay Lon Mother & Child Hospital have turned the spotlight on the deplorable state of neonatal healthcare in Rajasthan and sent the Ashok Gehlot government scrambling to mobilise resources. While questions are being raised about the crumbling infrastructure, staff shortage and poor hygiene at Jay Kay Lon-pigs were found roaming inside the premises-by all accounts, this had been a tragedy waiting to happen.The death toll of 100 in December-the hospital\\'s worst for the month in the past five years-consists of mostly underweight newborns, many of whom were referred here from other maternity and non-specialised medical centres. In 2019, the average mortality rate at Jay Kay Lon was 5.6 per cent of the total admissions and 19 per cent of the admissions in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). For the record, infant fatalities at the hospital have been the lowest in 2019, if figures for the past five years are taken into account.Paediatricians at Jay Kay Lon often say \"jugaad (stop-gap)\" is the order of the day. They say, so poor is the hospital\\'s layout it offers little sunlight-so essential for newborns. The NICU, set up in 2011-12, does not follow prescribed norms, such as an oxygen pipeline and air-conditioning to maintain temperatures at 27-30 degrees Celsius. In winters, newborns are kept comfortable with warmers and room heaters.In 2012, the Gehlot government had sanctioned 60 beds for children and 60 for gynaecology, but the subsequent BJP government allowed only 45 in gynaecology. Both governments have failed to build a new wing here under the Mother and Child Hospital scheme of the central government. Little surprise then that the hospital\\'s NICU and emergency neonatal ward, which have sanctioned bed strengths of 42 and 21 respectively, pack in two, three and even four babies per bed, and nurses cater to many more babies than the standard protocol recommends.Following the hue and cry after the current spate of deaths, the Gehlot government on January 2 ordered the setting up of a 12-bed NICU which is expected to be ready within three months. Much of the medical equipment that had broken down, including warmers, infusion pumps and ventilators, has been repaired or replaced. Eighty per cent of the senior doctor posts in paediatrics are vacant. While there is no word on when this shortfall will be bridged, the government has now appointed a senior professor, four assistant professors and 27 nurses. They are expected to join duty within six months. \"While these measures will improve the quality of treatment by reducing the stress on doctors, any significant improvement in the mortality rate in the NICU or the hospital overall is unlikely,\" says Vijay Kumar Sardana, principal, Government Medical College, Kota, to which Jay Kay Lon is attached. Sardana says he is confident that every baby that died here had been given the required care. A significant improvement in mortality rate here is only possible if the Gehlot government quickly approves the proposal for a new wing with air-conditioned NICUs.Gehlot has called the deaths unfortunate, but not unusual. On his request, the Union health ministry has sent a team of experts to Rajasthan to study how the neonatal care infrastructure at Jay Kay Lon can be revamped, including the speedy transportation of critical babies to big hospitals.Gehlot says his government\\'s plan to add 18 government medical colleges and upgrade district hospitals for the purpose will vastly improve access to medicare in the next few years. Gehlot described the chorus of condemnation from the BJP, including from Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla, who represents the Kota constituency, as a tactic to divert attention from the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the economic slowdown.Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot, however, has called his government\\'s response insensitive and demanded accountability. \"People elected us because the BJP governed the state poorly. After being a year in power, we cannot blame the BJP,\" he said, inviting a rebuke from health minister Raghu Sharma. \"I take the blame for every hospital death, but what about Pilot\\'s public works department-which is entrusted with the maintenance of hospitals-taking months to repair leaking ceilings and broken windows there?\" he asked. Clearly, Gehlot is not only battling a healthcare emergency in Kota but malcontent in his own cabinet.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " '\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n Capital ConflictChief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy looks to abandon Amaravati, plugging instead for decentralised development.advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Amarnath K. Menon     January 10, 2020 ISSUE DATE: January 20, 2020UPDATED: January 10, 2020 15:48 IST  Tri-junction: CM Jagan Reddy (Photo: Vikram Sharma)Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy appears determined to dash the development plans of his predecessor, N. Chandrababu Naidu. Reddy is preparing to disperse the state capital to three locations-Amaravati, Visakhapatnam and Kurnool.In a report submitted to the chief minister on December 20, 2019, an expert committee headed by retired bureaucrat G. Nageswara Rao had recommended that the state administration be shifted to Visakhapatnam, while the state legislature remains in Amaravati and the high court shifts to Kurnool. Soon after, on January 3, the state government-appointed Boston Consulting Group (BCG) presented its report, which largely agreed with the Rao committee report, recommending decentralised development for the state. Highlighting the economic risk of developing a new capital-through an analysis of 30 greenfield capitals across the globe-the BCG report also noted that aside from Shenzhen and Navi Mumbai, all others had failed to achieve their development targets. As a next step, Chief Minister Reddy has tasked a 16-member committee headed by state finance minister Buggana Rajendranath to study the two reports and present the findings to the legislative assembly before the end of January.However, ex-CM Naidu has rubbished the plan, calling the reports \"waste paper for the Bhogi bonfire rituals ahead of Sankranti\". A lot is at stake for Naidu, who spent much political capital selling the idea of Amaravati as a dream city. Not everyone agreed with that vision, with many suspecting the new city would also serve as a mega real estate venture to benefit the Kamma caste, the dominant group in Naidu\\'s Telugu Desam Party (TDP). Extensive land purchases in and around Amaravati by the Kamma community and other TDP leaders have reinforced this impression and led to allegations of \\'insider trading\\'. While nothing has been proved, a cabinet sub-committee looking into the matter alleged large land purchases by elected representatives, people close to Naidu and by companies in which he owned shares in the period leading up to Amaravati being declared the capital in December 2014. Though Naidu has dismissed these as baseless, CM Reddy is likely to order a probe.However, the TDP is not alone in its opposition. Investors in Amaravati are reportedly apprehensive of poorer-than-expected returns, and farmers who had consented to the land-pooling agreement by which Amaravati\\'s lands were acquired are restive. Even the BJP is against the plan: \"The central government, farmers and bond-holders are also stakeholders [in this matter],\" says state BJP president Kanna Lakshmi Narayana. \"Farmers gave 33,000 acres [under the land-pooling agreement] and the Centre has spent Rs 2,500 crore for the development of Amaravati.\"But CM Reddy appears confident of his three-city plan. Arguing for decentralised development, he says, \"We believe that [development] will be just only if water, funds and administration are equally available to all.\"Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Thackeray has lost direct control over 70 per cent of the state budget and conceded most big-ticket portfolios (including home and finance) in the first expansion of the cabinet on January 5. Only two big departments, urban development and agriculture, are with the Shiv Sena.Political analyst Hemant Desai says NCP chief Sharad Pawar\\'s stamp is all over the government. \"It\\'s obvious that Thackeray has had to compromise,\" he says. Thackeray\\'s close confidant Anil Parab, the minister for legislative affairs, admits that \"you can\\'t always have an advantage in a coalition\" but maintains their \"tuning is fine\".A Sena strategist says the party is looking to broaden its base in rural areas, especially in Vidarbha and western Maharashtra. The agriculture department is with the Sena and a good run for the rural economy could give the party a boost. But that\\'s easier said than done. His two big announcements-loan waivers to farmers and the Shiv Bhojan Rs 10 meal for the poor scheme-will most likely see the allies stealing his thunder. The loan waiver scheme will be implemented jointly by the finance and cooperatives departments headed by the NCP\\'s Ajit Pawar and Balasaheb Patil, respectively. With most co-op banks under NCP control, the party is likely to use the loan waiver amount to strengthen the finances of the banks. \\'Shiv Bhojan\\' falls under the food and civil supplies department, again hea\\xadded by NCP\\'s Chhagan Bhujbal.Thackeray managed to hold on to the agriculture department despite pressure from the Congress. Political observers believe this could result in a bigger mess as agriculture minister Dadaji Bhuse is a relative newbie to the field. Farmer leaders Vijay Jawandhiya and Ajit Navale have already upped the ante accusing the new government of apathy over the plight of flood-affected farmers. At least 300 farmers have committed suicide since November 28, when Thackeray assumed office.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Roy's ministerial stint in the Das government was marked by controversy as he raked up alleged corruption and questioned decisions. Denied a ticket by the BJP, he contested the poll as an Independent. Excerpts from an interview:Q. You are a giant-slayer who proved to be the nemesis of Raghubar Das and three previous chief ministers.Whatever I have done is for a cause. I have no personal animosity towards any leader I've exposed. Individuals, irrespective of their positions, do not matter. I believe that the cause, the enormity of the issue, should be the driver.Q. Did you alert the BJP central leadership about the alleged irregularities happening during the time Raghubar Das was in power?Besides registering my dissent during cabinet meetings, I raised corruption issues within the BJP and even spoke to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2017. The PM advised me to share my concerns with the party. I met BJP chief Amit Shah, who promised to improve things in Jharkhand. Things improved temporarily. With 16 departments under his control, Das operated in a highly centralised manner. The BJP leadership erred in trusting him too much.Q. Why do you think Raghubar Das lost the election to you?Not only were people disillusioned by him, even BJP workers were demoralised because of Das's arr\\xadogance. The voters of Jamshedpur East backed me as I inspired trust.Q. What is your opinion about Chief Minister Hemant Soren?I have known him since childhood; I shared a warm personal relationship with his father Shibu Soren. We struck a rapport when Nitish Kumar was sworn in as Bihar chief minister for a brief span in 2000 and Shibu Soren agreed to back him. Hemant is a young politician with a kind heart and commitment to improve things in Jharkhand. He has the opportunity to do so now.Q.

Shivakumar\\'s constituency, Kan\\xadakapura, has triggered a row in Karnataka. The 10 acres allotted to the Harobele Kapala Betta Development Trust in 2016 \\'for religious purposes\\', have become the site of a controversy between the leaders of the Christian and Hindu communities. Originally ear\\xadma\\xadrked as a gomala (grasslands for cattle grazing), the BJP now says it cannot be transferred to any trust for religious purposes. The party\\'s government in the state has ordered a probe.It all began when Shivakumar attended an event on December 25 to mark the commencement of work on the statue. \"I have visited the site several times,\" he says. \"All necessary due diligence was done before handing over the land to the trust. Christians have been praying on the hilltop for decades. They refer to Kapala Betta as Jesus Cross Hill. These developments are unfortunate.\"Revenue minister R. Ashoka has flayed the \\'illegal\\' construction of the statue. \"They (the trust) have laid a road to the site without approvals. Electricity to the site has been supplied without permission. A probe has been ordered into the matter. We will initiate action based on the findings,\" he says.The BJP has received support from various Hindu organisations and seers. Rishikumara Swami, the pontiff of Kali Mutt, says the name Kapala Betta refers to Lord Shiva and that the hill was used by Hindu saints for meditation. \"We will launch a massive protest if the government allows the trust to build the statue,\" he warns.Political analysts says the issue is more political than religi\\xadous. \"This is typical of the BJP-trying to find a foothold by raking up sensitive issues,\" says political historian A. Veerappa. \"Both the Idgah Maidan row in Hubballi and the Datta Peeta controversy in Bababudangiri Hills helped the BJP expand its base in Karnataka. Now they are trying to make inroads into south Karnataka.\" The BJP has often considered south Karnataka their last frontier in the state. \"Kapala Betta is their opportunity,\" says Veerappa.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " '\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n The Battle for DelhiWith the election dates out, AAP and the BJP are set for another showdown. Who will be left standing on February 11?advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Gulam Jeelani    January 10, 2020 ISSUE DATE: January 20, 2020UPDATED: January 10, 2020 15:42 IST  Catch them young: CM Arvind Kejriwal at a mega PTA event in a government school in Delhi, January 4 (Photo: Sonu Mehta/Getty Images)On December 24, while releasing a \\'report card\\' of the work done by his Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in the past five years, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said his was the \"most honest\" government in the country. \"I can say with assurance that post-Independence, this has been the most honest government in the country. There were all sorts of agencies probing us, but we got a clean chit from all of them,\" says Kejriwal.Delhi goes to polls on February 8; counting of votes for the 70-member assembly will be done on February 11. The Kejriwal-led AAP is seeking re-election after securing a thumping majority in 2015, winning 67 of the 70 seats. As the polls draw near, AAP is relying on its \"work\" and the BJP on PM Narendra Modi\\'s \"popularity\" to see them through. The Congress, which had ruled Delhi for 15 years before AAP, is hoping for a resurgence, especially after the results in Maharashtra and Jharkhand.After the drubbing in the 2019 general election (the BJP won all seven Lok Sabha seats in the capital), AAP started work on the assembly poll with a massive propaganda outreach on the work it has done. Kejriwal also announced sops, including free rides for women in DTC buses, free electricity up to 200 units, free WiFi, to name a few. \"National issues are important in Lok Sabha elections, but assembly polls are won on local issues. We will repeat 2015 in 2020,\" says Sanjay Singh, Rajya Sabha MP and AAP in-charge for the Delhi polls.There has been a big change in Kejriwal\\'s public posture too. Once a vociferous critic of PM Modi, Kejriwal is not indulging in any Modi- or Centre-bashing in this campaign. Analysts say he doesn\\'t want to be pigeonholed as just a Modi-baiter, more so because studies seem to indicate that Delhi voters too vote differently in national and local elections.A Lokniti-CSDS post-poll survey after the May 2019 Lok Sabha election revealed that 24 per cent of those who voted for the BJP said they might switch to AAP in the assembly election. \"I see it as a direct contest between the AAP and BJP, with the former having an edge,\" says Sanjay Kumar, director, Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS).Unlike 2015, Kejriwal is also assisted in the campaign this time around by poll strategist Prashant Kishor and his Indian Political Action Committee (IPAC). AAP leaders says Kejriwal\\'s makeover was one of Kishor\\'s big tasks.For the BJP, winning Delhi is more than just a prestige issue (given its recent sub-par performances). The party has not been in power here for over two decades. Also, the polls will serve as feedback on the contentious CAA and NRC. No wonder the party is pulling out all the stops with its president and Union home minister Amit Shah going door-to-door in the capital.\"PM Modi\\'s leadership is well known in the country. We will fight the election with full strength,\" Union minister Prakash Javadekar, the BJP\\'s Delhi in-charge, told reporters on January 6.The party\\'s Delhi unit chief Manoj Tiwari is also confident. \"The people of Delhi are fed up with AAP\\'s blame-game politics,\" says Tiwari, now the North East Delhi MP.The Congress faces an uphill task, especially after the demise of three-time CM, Sheila Dikshit. The party failed to win a seat in the two previous parliamentary polls and drew a blank in the 2015 assembly election too.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " \"\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n Thackeray's tightrope walkFrom lambasting Hindutva politics to giving plum portfolios to allies NCP and Congress, Uddhav Thackeray is doing everything he can to keep his government steady.advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Kiran Tare  Mumbai January 3, 2020 ISSUE DATE: January 13, 2020UPDATED: January 4, 2020 09:00 IST  Chief Minister Uddhav ThackerayOn December 17, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray strongly criticised the police action at Delhi’s Jamia Millia Islamia University during a protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), equating it to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre during British rule a century ago. Thackeray was speaking during the state legislature session in Nagpur. Later, he even said that his party, the Shiv Sena, had made a grave mistake in the past by mixing Hindutva with politics.While the remark is a major departure from the Sena’s hardcore Hindutva politics, political analysts see it as Thackeray’s attempt to signal that the Sena and its coalition partners, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress, have put their ideological differences aside and found a common wavelength for their Maha Vikas Aghadi’ government in the state. It only helped that NCP president Sharad Pawar welcomed the chief minister’s comments, saying that the state government appeared to be on the right track.More proof of deft coalition manoeuvring by Thackeray was evident at his first cabinet expansion on December 30. Not only did the NCP bag most of the prominent portfolios, such as home, finance, public works, excise, housing and labour, Thackeray even agreed to the ally’s demand to induct Sharad Pawar’s powerful nephew Ajit Pawar as his deputy. It was Ajit’s attempt to wean away NCP MLAs and prop up a Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP government that had precipitated the political crisis in Maharashtra in November until Sharad Pawar stepped in to nip the rebellion in his party in the bud and ensure the formation of the Sena-NCP-Congress government.The Shiv Sena got only two important portfolios industry and urban development, which gives it authority to control the civic bodies in urban areas whereas plum departments like revenue, power and school education went to the Congress. Underpinning his secular credentials, Thackeray is the first state chief minister to induct four Muslims into the cabinet Hasan Mushrif, Nawab Malik, Aslam Shaikh and Abdul Sattar.In his month-long stint at the helm so far, Thackeray has made it a point not to antagonise his allies. Toeing their line without adequate homework he announced a loan waiver for farmers on December 21. A week later, though, it became clear that Thackeray’s scheme came with a rider: only farmers with a collective debt of up to Rs 2 lakh would be eligible. Also, the outstanding loan and interest should be for the period July 1, 2015 to September 30, 2019. In case the loan amount is restructured before March 31, 2020, the new amount needs to be under Rs 2 lakh to be eligible.An earlier scheme, implemented by the previous BJP-Sena government, provisioned for a waiver of up to Rs 1.5 lakh irrespective of the outstanding loan amount. Maharashtra BJP president Chandrakant Patil says that the new scheme won’t benefit too many farmers as loans between 2001 and 2016 had already been waived. Farmer leader Vijay Jawandhia said that Thackeray had promised a blanket loan waiver only to do a U-turn.Thackeray could not give details of the estimated number of beneficiaries of his scheme. We have kept our word on making farmers debt-free, he merely said. Finance minister Jayant Patil, however, claims the new scheme will be bigger than the Rs 34,000 crore waiver implemented by the Fadnavis government.Thackeray has also accepted the Congress-NCP’s demand to remove political representatives from cooperative bodies, such as sugar mills and Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMC), mostly controlled by the Congress and the NCP. The chief minister also conceded to the demand to discard the multiple ward representatives system in municipal corporations and restored the one ward, one representative system.Thackeray says the three allies have accepted each other. I am delighted to see workers of all three parties comfortably mingling with each other, he told India Today at an informal interaction. That shows our government will last its full term.Fadnavis, who is leader of the opposition in the state assembly, however, disagrees. He says the auto-rickshaw government will collapse under its own weight within a year and accuses the government of cheating farmers. Those affected by unseasonal rains in October have been completely left out [of the loan waiver], says Fadnavis.Another BJP leader, however, predicts that the government will complete its five years. Power has given the Congress and NCP a new lease of life in Maharashtra and they would be desperate for the government to continue, he feels. Uddhavji might be able to save the government, but not his core voters in the future.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n Indirect VictoryThe state urban bodies’ election favours Baghel’s Congress government.advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Rahul Noronha  Chattisgarh January 3, 2020 ISSUE DATE: January 13, 2020UPDATED: January 3, 2020 12:38 IST  The Bhupesh Baghel government’s gambit to hold indirect elections to urban local bodies (ULBs) has paid off. The Congress, which had won just four of the 10 municipal corporations in 2014, is set to control nine now, perhaps even bagging the tenth if behind-the-scenes negotiations work out.Ten municipal corporations, 38 municipalities and 103 nagar panchayats went to the polls on December 21. The last three polls to ULBs were held through the direct format, with the electorate voting for corporators and the head of the urban body (mayors in municipal corporations and chairpersons of municipalities and nagar panchayats) directly.The state gov\\xad\\xadernment had amended the Chhattisgarh Municipal Corporation Act, 1956 and the Chhattisgarh Municipalities Act, 1961 in October 2019, the result of which was that heads of ULBs were now to be elected by corporators. Elections were held to choose corporators only.The decision was criti\\xadci\\xadsed by the BJP, which felt that indirect elections would promote horse trading and corporators being swayed by the ruling party. The decision was also opposed by the bureaucracy. In indirect elections, the mayor or chairperson is at the mercy of corporators, who could threaten them with withdrawal of supp\\xadort. Also, it slows down the process of decision-making, says a senior civil servant in Chhattisgarh.In the 10 municipal corp\\xado\\xadra\\xadtions that went to the polls, the Congress won an absolute majority in Ambikapur, Chirmiri and Jagdalpur; won half the wards in Bilaspur, Raigarh and Durg; and was the single-largest party in the Raipur, Dhamtari and Rajnandgaon corporations. In Korba, though, the BJP won more wards, but fell short of a majority on its own.The Congress is not acknowledging the role of indirect elections in its victory. It is a result of the work done by the Baghel government...it’s also a rejection of the politics of the BJP, says Shailesh N. Trivedi, state Congress spokesperson.BJP state chief Vikram Usendi, however, said a clear majority for the Congress in only three corporations reflects the unpopularity of the Baghel government in its first year itself.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n Varsity PuppetsWhile cornering the governor-chancellor, the TMC regime has made V-Cs ciphers too.advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Romita Datta  Kolkata January 3, 2020 ISSUE DATE: January 13, 2020UPDATED: January 3, 2020 12:38 IST  Governor Dhankar after students blocked his convoy in Jadavpur, Dec 24A long with the move to strip the governor of his powers as chancellor of universities, the Mamata Banerjee government has disempowered the vice-chancellors as well. As per the new rules, framed on December 12, as a corollary to the West Bengal University and College (Administration and Regulation) Act, 2017, V-Cs have to kowtow to the higher education department on all matters of any consequence and some of none at all even academic tours or MoUs with other institutes.The 2017 act had effectively gag\\xadged teachers, preventing them from airing grievances against the state; even speaking to the media was prohibited. Governor Jagdeep Dhankar says education is being held in captivity. Incidentally, the process of getting yesmen as V-Cs began soon after the Trinamool Congress came to power in 2011. The higher education department minimised the role of varsity bodies in selections, vesting supreme power in a three-member panel.Initially, the committee consisted of a nominee each from the UGC and the university decision-making body, besides the chancellor. Problems arose first when the chancellor (the governor, by default) preferred the UGC nominee, overriding the preference of the state for Jadavpur University in 2012. Soon, the government did away with the UGC nominee, and instead had its own rep\\xadresentative. By stalling election for the posts of elected representatives from among staff and students, the nominated’ ex-officio members soon outnumbered the elected posts and became the decisive voice.The rules have turned the universities into extended offices of the government. The new guidelines have been introduced as rules to bypass a debate in the assembly. This is just a deceitful way to rob the universities of their auto\\xadnomy, says Sujan Chakraborty, leader of the Left parties in the assembly.The V-C’s powers are so curtailed he cannot even call meetings of executive bodies. These laws are arbitrary. We do not want our universities to be run either by Bikash Bhawan (state education department HQ) or Raj Bhawan. This is a classic case of [jumping out of the] frying pan [into] fire, says Partha Pratim Biswas, president of the Jadavpur University Teachers Union.The West Bengal College and Uni\\xadv\\xadersity Teachers Association is now planning protests and rallies to canvass public opinion. Education minis\\xadter Partha Chatterjee is unm\\xadoved.

       " \"\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n Mature Soren adopts soft touch policySoren withdraws case against former CM Raghubar Das, drops tenancy law and protest cases against thousands in a bid to reassure tribals.advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Amitabh Srivastava    Ranchi January 3, 2020 ISSUE DATE: January 13, 2020UPDATED: January 3, 2020 12:37 IST  A day after election results handed the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM)-led opposition alliance a decisive victory 47 MLAs in the 81-member Jharkhand assembly Hemant Soren drove to the residence of Babulal Marandi, chief of the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM).Unwilling to back Soren as the chief ministerial candidate, Marandi had broken away from the JMM-led alliance in November and contested the assembly poll on his own. The results proved how unwise the decision was. Though its three-seat haul had left the JVM in a position of no leverage, Soren nevertheless made it a point to meet Marandi and seek advice’. The gesture floored Marandi, who declared unconditional support’ to the new government.Next, Soren withdrew a case under the SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act that he had lodged against former chief minister and rival Raghubar Das of the BJP. Soren had filed a complaint on December 19 over an objectionable comment made by Das.Soren appears to have opted for a more conciliatory approach in his new innings, unlike his first stint as state chief minister from July 2013 to December 2014, when many considered him headstrong. Despite his government’s wafer-thin majority, he had fired three ministers from his cabinet.For the Lok Sabha election, he settled for fewer seats for the JMM and let the Congress lead the alliance. In return, he was assured of the party’s support for the assembly contest.In the first cabinet meeting held hours after Soren took oath as chief minister on December 29, the government decided to withdraw criminal cases lodged against thousands of people who had agitated against the previous BJP government’s proposed amendments to tenancy laws. Most of the cases were filed in 2017. Although the Das government had claimed that the proposed amendments to the Chota Nagpur Tenancy Act and the Santhal Parganas Tenancy Act were meant to plug loopholes in age-old laws, they were seen as a ploy to dilute tribal control over land. Tribal ire proved to be one of the major reasons for the BJP’s defeat in the election.The Soren government has also decided to drop sedition charges slapped on several tribal activists of the Pathalgadi movement, which had rocked the state’s Khunti district, adjoining Ranchi, and its bordering areas and turned violent in 2017-2018.The two decisions will likely reassure the state’s tribal community which makes up 26.3 per cent of the electorate and is the JMM’s core base as well as send a signal that the Soren government does not intend to be confrontational or vindictive. The chief minister, however, made it clear to India Today that those facing corruption charges will not be let off the hook (see interview).The Jharkhand result has come as a morale-booster for the opposition after the BJP-AJSU Party tie-up swept the state in the Lok Sabha poll, winning 12 of the 14 seats. Soren played a key role in keeping the opposition alliance intact and seized the opportunity when the BJP and AJSU Party parted ways before the assembly election. At Soren’s swearing-in, the presence of a galaxy of opposition leaders, who joined hands in a show of strength, suggests that the Jharkhand victory may have provided the opposition more than a reason to stay united at the national level.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

Take Tul Palav, an online apparel brand known for fine Kashmiri garments. Before the government pulled the plug on internet services on August 4 in the run-up to the abrogation of Article 370, the company was on tight deadlines ahead of Eid. The current internet shutdown has been the longest, surpassing the previous 133 days when Hizbul commander Burhan Wani was killed in July 2016.Today, brand owner Iqra Ahmed is struggling to keep the company afloat. From the 30 big orders every month, the past four months saw only five orders on their social media page, says the 27-year-old. \"I could not update samples of the new collection. Also, I could not communicate with my workers or family in the initial months when mobile phones were also not working,\" she says. \"My workers from outside J&K left.\"Till August 4, the Instagram page of Tul Palav (nearly 50,000 followers) was full of photos of \\'traditional wear with modern cuts\\', including pherans, which are popular in winter among the diaspora as well. The venture used to get more than 10 orders a month from clients in the US and West Asia on Instagram alone.Many entrepreneurs shifted to Delhi to keep ventures running but that is not helping either. Kashmir Box, a well-known online start-up known for selling products ranging from traditional Kashmir produce to handicrafts, has 30 staffers at its office in Srinagar\\'s Nawab Bazar. But the Valley\\'s first e-commerce firm, which at one point was delivering products to almost 30 countries, shows no sign of life now. \"The internet was our life-blood, we can\\'t sustain ourselves without it,\" says an employee. The company has an office in Delhi, but it is impossible to run operations from there as products have to come from Kashmir.In the Gupkar Road neighbourhood in Srinagar, entrepreneur Saqib Mir is sitting in his rented office on a rainy December afternoon. The 32-year-old\\'s food venture, \\'Kolahai Waters\\', launched in 2014, had quickly become a success. He had 300-odd staffers at one point but everything has stalled now. \"We had an online service providing all material for marriages at one place,\" says Mir. Burdened with Rs 70 lakh in bank loans, he has decided to wind up operations.A Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) report has compiled losses from August 5 till December 3. It puts the losses at Rs 17,878 crore and almost 500,000 job cuts. KCCI president Sheikh Ashiq says the apprehension now is a surge in bank NPAs, with most young entrepreneurs on the verge of collapse. The Jammu and Kashmir Bank, the primary lender in the region, has recommended a moratorium on loans due to the shutdown, but there is no clarity about it yet. \"Both bank and private borrowings are piling up. Entrepreneurs had got soft loans in the past, but they are all collapsing now,\" says Sheikh.The state government had rolled out a J&K Start-up Policy in 2018 to nurture 500 start-ups in a decade. The J&K Entrepreneurship Development Institute was key in this, providing soft loans under different schemes. Established in the late 1990s, it has trained over 29,000 youth and helped set up close to 14,500 ventures in food processing, floriculture, textiles, apparel, horticulture, poultry farms etc.Institute director Tufail Mattoo admits entrepreneurs have been affected, but calls it a \"temporary phase\". \"They will get over it. During monthly reviews, we have learnt that things are picking up again. Also, we have provided net facility here,\" he says.A bitter Saqib Mir says it\\'s all just a front to get publicity. \"They set us up to see us collapse.

The chief minister recently returned from a 10-day tour of Japan and South Korea where the state explored technological and economic cooperation and sought investment in industries, tourism and fisheries. Investments to the tune of Rs 300 crore came through during the visit, Pinarayi informed the media on his return. He said while Japan\\'s Nitta Gelatin Inc. has promised an investment of Rs 200 crore to manufacture gelatin for pharmaceuticals and food applications, Terumo Corp., another Japanese firm, will put in Rs 105 crore to manufacture blood bags. Both companies already have investments in Kerala.Pinarayi\\'s latest tour had come amid allegations by the opposition that his international travels were \"pleasure trips with family\" that were bleeding the exchequer. \"It\\'s a clear case of extravaganza at a time the state is reeling under a financial crisis. Pinarayi Vijayan has driven the state to peril,\" alleged Mullappally Ramachandran, chief of the state Congress Committee.Pinarayi defends his foreign travels, saying: \"My tours are for the youth of Kerala. We need mega investments to fast-track development.\" According to a senior bureaucrat who was part of the delegation to Japan and Korea, \"The chief minister had a hectic schedule. He showcased Kerala before investors and sought their cooperation. This is the first time a Kerala chief minister is making efforts to market the state to global investors.\"Coming to power in May 2016, one of Pinarayi\\'s priorities has been to improve the state\\'s business environment. With Kerala ranked 21st in the state-wise ease of doing business rankings for 2017, he had his work cut out. Pinarayi aimed to turn Kerala into a hub of service and technology in order to create jobs and dispel the investor-phobia typically associated with communist governments. \"In 2018, Pinarayi Vijayan put an end to nokkukooli (gawking fees) charged by trade unions. In Kerala\\'s context, it was not easy,\" says an aide of the chief minister. \"He also streamlined industrial policies. In the past three and a half years, 11 global companies have set up projects in the state.\"The government has also introduced single-window clearances for projects, with an officer of the rank of additional private secretary monitoring proposals and cutting delays in issuing licences to industry. Under K-Swift, the Single Window Interface for Fast & Transparent Clearance, the government has assured clearance to projects within 30 days of applying.In his tenure, Pinarayi has led business delegations to the UAE, US, the Netherlands, Switzerland, France and the UK. The government says the visits attracted foreign investments worth around Rs 1,700 crore-in IT, health, tourism, education, fisheries and manufacturing.\"The Left government has [declared] its performance record every year. We are committed to providing Kerala a new direction,\" says LDF convenor A. Vijayaraghavan. He is confident that the opposition\\'s campaigns against the Pinarayi government will be rejected by the people and their enhanced quality of life will speak for the chief minister\\'s governance model.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " \"\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n Bihar: The ‘return’ of Pappu YadavThe former Lok Sabha MP’s flood relief effort paid off in the recent Patna university student elections. A comeback?advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Amitabh Srivastava    New Delhi December 23, 2019 ISSUE DATE: December 30, 2019UPDATED: December 25, 2019 16:47 IST  RESCUE ACT: Pappu Yadav and his aides wade through a flooded Patna street with relief material in September (Photo: Sonu Kishan)Crisis is often an opportunity in disguise, and Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav, Bihar’s don-turned-politician and five-term Lok Sabha MP, grabbed one this September when torrential rains lashed Patna.Three days of blinding rains, beginning September 27, had left more than half the city under waist-deep water, displacing thousands of people. As boats criss-crossed streets and Patna resembled a marooned habitation, Yadav emerged on the scene as an unlikely hero. With a hundred-odd volunteers from his Jan Adhikar Party (JAP), he waded through the waterlogged areas for days, distributing food and medicines, and rescuing people.When the flood waters receded, Yadav held a medical camp for the people. That he made these efforts in Patna, where he is thought to have no political base, was surprising. The 51-year-old leader, who served jail term in a murder case before being acquitted in 2013, has won all his Lok Sabha elections from the Kosi region, some 300 km from Patna.Two months on, his hard work seems to be paying off. The JAP, which was launched in 2015, made a splash in the Patna University students’ union election, winning the president’s post. Manish, the victorious candidate, attributed his feat to Yadav’s flood relief.Though the JAP’s success in the university may not be significant in the overall political scene in Bihar, observers feel it is a good start for the fledgling party. Even Lalu Prasad shot into limelight after being elected Patna University students’ union president in 1973. Sushil Kumar Modi became general secretary, says a JAP official.JAP leaders say the victory could not have come at a better time for Yadav, who failed to retain the Madhepura seat in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. His wife Ranjeet Ranjan, the sitting MP from Supaul, too, lost her seat.Patna has long been a BJP bastion. While the party lost the 2015 assembly election to the mahagathbandhan, it won all five assembly segments in Patna. It also controls the city’s municipal corporation. JAP insiders say the party is considering contesting all seats in Patna in the 2020 assembly poll, and Yadav could be in the fray from one of the seats.Yadav sure knows how to keep the pot boiling till then. In October, he drove a garbage-laden tractor to a Bihar minister’s home in Patna and threatened to dump the trash there. More recently, during the onion crisis, he sold onions at concessional rates in front of the BJP office in the city. Observers see these as attempts to pitch himself as the only viable alternative to the BJP in Patna.Yadav’s consuming political ambitions have done him no favours in the past. The RJD suspended him after the 2014 Lok Sabha election, when he was seen to be trying to usurp Lalu’s legacy. The Congress and the JD(U) have slammed the door on him. Even the BJP seems disinterested. All this has landed Yadav in a crisisand maybe presented him an opportunity.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " '\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n Maharashtra: Rebels with a \\'Cause\\'OBC leaders Pankaja Munde and Eknath Khadse blame Devendra Fadnavis for the BJP\\'s failure to secure a majority in the state election.advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Kiran D. Tare  New Delhi December 23, 2019 ISSUE DATE: December 30, 2019UPDATED: December 25, 2019 16:47 IST  AGREEING TO DISAGREE? Pankaja Munde with former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis (Photo: Getty Images)On December 12, as she addressed a rally of thousands of supporters in her hometown Beed in central Maharashtra, influential BJP leader Pankaja Munde\\'s words had a challenge wrapped in an exhortation. Addressing her constituency of OBC (Other Backward Class) voters, who have been BJP loyalists, she said: \"The BJP has been a bahujan party. Don\\'t allow it to be controlled by a handful [of leaders].\"Munde, 40, did not name anyone, but to many, the apparent target was former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, with whom she has had volatile ties. Like heavyweight OBC leader Eknath Khadse, Munde too feels that 49-year-old Fadnavis, a Brahmin, should take the blame for the BJP\\'s failure to secure a majority on its own in the October assembly election.Munde lost the Parli assembly seat to cousin Dhananjay Munde of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), by 32,000 votes. The defeat was all the more humiliating as she was the only BJP candidate for whom both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah had campaigned. Khadse\\'s daughter Rohini, who replaced him in the Muktainagar seat, lost to independent candidate Chandrakant Patil by about 5,000 votes. \"Someone at the top was responsible for the defeat,\" says Khadse. \"If seniors like me, Vinod Tawde and Prakash Mehta had been involved in the poll campaign, we would have won 25 more seats for the party.\" With 105 seats, the BJP ended up 40 short of a simple majority in the state assembly.Khadse and Munde are members of the BJP\\'s core committee, which takes policy decisions. They have announced a boycott of the committee\\'s meetings till the party fixes responsibility for their defeats. \"Fadnavis was on Dhananjay\\'s side. He sanctioned all financial proposals of the NCP leader,\" says a Munde supporter.Munde has announced a statewide tour with other OBC leaders from January. \"I will not quit. Let the party sack me,\" she says. So far, Munde has the backing of two MLAs-Monika Rajale and Madhuri Misal-Khadse, Mehta and former BJP minister Babanrao Lonikar.Maharashtra\\'s OBCs have been a BJP vote-bank, accounting for almost half its votes. In the 1980s, the BJP\\'s Vasantrao Bhagwat played a key role in bringing three prominent OBC communities-Mali, Dhangar, Vanjari-into the party fold. This election, however, the party suffered the shock defeats of three key OBC leaders-Yogesh Tilekar, Ram Shinde and Munde.The Fadnavis-Munde rivalry surfaced soon after the BJP came to power in Maharashtra in 2014. Munde made her chief ministerial aspirations known and claimed she was the only state BJP leader with a mass following. In 2015, Fadnavis relieved Munde of the water conservation portfolio even as she was attending a conference in Singapore. The same year, however, he backed Munde after she was accused of being involved in an alleged scam.Two prominent OBC leaders, Girish Mahajan and Chandrashekhar Bawankule, have expressed solidarity with Fadnavis, calling him a visionary leader and an outstanding administrator.However, the BJP could have a messy rebellion in its ranks unless the differences between the former chief minister and Pankaja are sorted out.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " '\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n Chhattisgarh: The Paddy WarThe state and Centre are locked in a battle overpayment of an MSP+ bonus.advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Rahul Noronha  New Delhi December 23, 2019 ISSUE DATE: December 30, 2019UPDATED: December 25, 2019 16:47 IST  TAKING STOCK: A paddy centre in Raipur (Photo: Bhupesh Kesharwani)Procurement of paddy in Chhattisgarh has become controversial as the Union government has refused to allow the state government to pay farmers a bonus over and above the minimum support price (MSP). With panchayat elections round the corner, political parties have hardened their stands. While Bhupesh Baghel, the state\\'s Congress chief minister, has dubbed the Centre\\'s stand anti-farmer, the local BJP unit, while unable to get the Centre to agree to the payment of bonus, is accusing Baghel of making an insincere promise. \"CM Bhupesh Baghel, when he was in the opposition, had demanded that procurement begin from November 1, but has now extended the date to December 1,\" said BJP Kisan Morcha\\'s Sandeep Sharma.This year, the Union government announced an MSP of Rs 1,815 per quintal for the common variety of paddy andRs 1,835 for the Grade A variety. The Baghel government had announced it would procure paddy at Rs 2,500 per quintal in 2019. This means it will have to pay bonuses at the rate of Rs 685 and Rs 665 per quintal respectively. The Centre has warned that if the state pays this bonus-something that distorts the market price of rice-it will not lift the nearly 3.2 million tonnes of rice the state provides to the central pool. Chhattisgarh will then have to bankroll the entire procurement, which it cannot do on its own.Initially, Baghel announced an agitation in Delhi to compel the Centre to come around, but gave up the idea. Then, a vehicle rally to Delhi was planned, which was also cancelled. \"The Union government had allowed the previous BJP government in the state to pay [an MSP+] bonus to farmers in 2018 and 2017 even though it stopped bonus payments from 2014 onwards. This was done to help the BJP win the assembly election. This smacks of double standards,\" he said.Invoking Chhattisgarhi asmita or pride, the CM says he has said his government will buy paddy at Rs 2,500 even if the Centre does not. He was hailed as a man with a \\'56-inch heart\\' to PM Modi\\'s \\'56-inch chest\\' at a farmers\\' meet, of which there have been several across the state.The Chhattisgarh government began paddy procurement from December 1, almost two weeks behind schedule, even though the Centre has not approved the procurement. The last date for procurement has been extended to mid-February. The state has targeted a procurement of 8.5 million tonnes of paddy this year. About 1.97 million farmers are registered with the state government for selling paddy. Sources in the state government privately say it does not want a full-blown confrontation with the Centre at this point. A five-member cabinet committee has been formed to work towards a resolution.Aware of the burgeoning procurement bill, the state has limited the quantity of paddy a farmer can sell to the government to 15 quintals per acre, even though average production ranges from 20-25 quintals per acre. This means farmers will be unable to sell their entire produce to the government, which is offering the best rates.An extended monsoon in October and November has given the state reason to believe total paddy production will touch 12.5 million tonnes, from 10.5 million tonnes in 2018. Chhattisgarh needs about 3 million tonnes of rice to meet its PDS requirement. It is expected that it will pick up the tab for the PDS rice even if the Centre does not agree to the bonus.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?

       " \"\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n Uttarakhand: Temple takeoverThe BJP state government’s move to secure the management of Uttarakhand’s big temples faces a backlash from Sangh outfits and godmen.advertisement\\n\\n\\n  Anilesh Mahajan  New Delhi December 19, 2019 ISSUE DATE: December 30, 2019UPDATED: December 23, 2019 11:49 IST  FAITH AND FINANCES: Pilgrims at the Gangotri temple celebrate Ganga Dussehra (Photo: Getty Images)In 2005, then Uttarakhand chief minister Narayan Dutt Tiwari had to withdraw a bill to take over the management of prominent temples in the state after his fellow Congress MLAs revolted. Fourteen years later, on the last day of the winter session, current chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat of the BJP successfully stewarded the Uttarakhand Devasthanam Management Bill through the state assembly. Once this becomes law, the new provisions will allow the state government to take over the management of 51 temples in Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri.The Tiwari regime stopped at setting up the Badrinath Kedarnath Temple Committee (BKTC), which continues to manages these temples. The shrines, which are open only in the summer months, received over 3 million pilgrims and donations worth Rs 12 crore in 2018-19. The numbers had gone down after the 2013 flash floods, but bounced back after the temples reopened.A senior Union cabinet minister in Delhi said the new law would help modernise facilities at the shrines. The BJP-led central government is linking four prominent Hindu pilgrimage sitesBadrinath, Dwarka, Jagannath Puri and Rameshwaramalong with 12 jyotirlingas, including Kedarnath, with highway nodes and railheads.But a big challenge now for the Rawat regime is to douse the anger over the move, and not just of party MLAs and cabinet colleagues but also of various godmen. Along with them, the teerth purohit (pilgrim priests), local businessmen and traders are also up in arms. These people are the traditional vote base of the BJP, says a party MLA. The temple towns have seen heavy snowfall, which will slow down the pace of life in this area, and buy some time for the chief minister. The priests had held a mahapanchayat mid-November to mount pressure on the chief minister to make changes in the law.The opposition Congress is in no mood to make life easy for Rawat. Party state unit chief Pritam Singh joined the protests and even committed that the law will be repealed if the party came to power after the 2022 assembly poll. Utt\\xadarakhand is not a state that favours incumbents, and that fact will worry Rawat too.Rawat, who had won over some the state’s godmen with his announcement of a grand temple for Sita in Pauri district (in Phalswari village, the place where she is said to have taken samadhi) and another grand temple for Raghunath (Rama) in Devaprayag, is suddenly facing the wrath of various senior leaders in the RSS and the VHP. Alok Kumar, working president of the VHP, says they (the protesters) will continue with the struggle but will maintain dialogue (with the establishment). Meanwhile, Baba Ramdev of Patanjali Yogapeeth met with agitating Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad national president Mahant NarendraGiri and extended his support. If the government wants to take over the management of religious places, they must do so of all institutions across religions. They can’t choose only Hindu pilgrimage sites, says Ramdev.The RSS and VHP stand is that the government should have a very limited role in managing religious shrines. The new law runs counter to this principle, says a top RSS leader preferring anonymity. The chief minister, who skipped the assembly when the bill was tabled, says it was hard to get a consensus on the issue. State tourism minister Satpal Maharaj added: We need this legislation to regularise and regulate things in a proper manner.These temples were traditionally managed by the BKTC, with the seniormost local MLA nominated as chairman, and members of local bodies and other prominent people from the region represented on the committee. The new bill will make the chief minister (if he is a Hindu) and the chief secretary members of the new board, with an IAS officer as CEO. The board will work on the lines of the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board and the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD). They will use the funds to improve infrastructure, develop the temple towns, and provide better facilities to people coming for the yatra, says a top state minister who, given the current controversy, also did not want to be named.Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from   Post your comment Do You Like This Story?
