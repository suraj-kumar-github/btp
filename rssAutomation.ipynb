(ANI Photo)LUCKNOW: From being the first to declare a coronavirus cluster in Agra -- much before the all-India lockdown was announced on March 24 -- to undertaking house-to-house contact-tracing, making self-reporting mandatory and building a specialized app to track the health of those under home isolation and quarantine, UP has set a template to combat the virus.\\n\\n\"Much before other states adopted the strategy of cluster containment to check the spread of coronavirus, UP had practised it successfully in Agra, when the first case surfaced on March 1,\" says a senior government on the condition on anonymity.\\n\\n\\nCoronavirus pandemic: Live updates\\n\\n\\n\"The district though has maximum number of cases in the state, the spread has been contained to clusters. In fact there was no case for 10 days till March 25, when the first cases of Tablighi Jamaat surfaced. Since then all cases are either linked to the jammat or two known sources,\" he says.\\n\\nWhile the state\\'s strategy has been lauded by the Union health ministry,additional chief secretary, home and information, UP Awanish Awasthi says: “Had it not been for our effective strategy, the number of cases in UP would have been much higher, adding \"Our work and strategy has been lauded by the union health ministry besides providing a model that can be emulated in other places.” he adds.\\n\\n\\nMore on Covid-19\\n\\n\\n\\nCoronavirus pandemic: Complete Coverage\\n21-day lockdown: What will stay open and what won\\'t\\nHow to quarantine yourself at home\\nTrust the newspaper for your daily verified news\\n\\n\\n“The template of \\'UP Model\\' was drawn in Khandari area of Agra in the first week of March when six persons of a leather exporters family became the first few to contract the infection. Steps taken in Agra not only controlled the situation in Agra, it provided the containment strategy that was used successfully in Noida and Meerut – listed among hotspots,” said state surveillance officer, Vikasendu Agarwal adding, “the model has widely appreciated by Union health authorities as well.”\\n\\nIt all started after six people of a shoe-exporter family were tested positive in Agra on March 2. These cases were linked to the son-in-law on the exporter, who was the first coronavirus case in Delhi.\\n\\nChief medical officer of Agra district, Dr Mukesh Kumar Vats, says that the airport tests confirmed the presence of coronavirus-affected patients in the city at around 2 am on March 1, and the team of officials immediately got into action. The area within a 3-km radius of the affected house in Khandari ara of the city was sealed in order to contain the virus in the area itself.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s time to mask up and stay safe: Join TOI\\'s #MaskIndia campaign\\n\\n\"Then, 259 teams, consisting of two members each, were formed and screened about 9 lakh people in over 1.6 lakh houses in the next few days. Around 1,000 samples were collected and the authorities transformed SN Medical College in the city to function as the base camp. Moreover, a security guard was taken on board to supply the necessities to the families in the sealed area,\" he adds.\\n\\n“Every single person who worked in the factory of the positive businessman was screened and tracked regularly. Likewise, the schools attended by the children who tested positive were sealed and sanitized. Eight days after the Agra family, a person from his factory tested positive. The local selective lockdown imposed by the district administration helped in keeping the numbers under control,” said Agarwal.\\n\\n\\nDownloadThe Times of India News App for Latest India NewsSubscribeStart Your Daily Mornings with Times of India Newspaper!
