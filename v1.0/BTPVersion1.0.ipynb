The restriction will not apply to people who have already registered their names on Seva Sindhu portal and secured passes for travel between states. \\n\\nAs many as 49,935 people from Maharashtra, 17,756 from Tamil Nadu and 2,563 people from Gujarat have registered their names to come to Karnataka as on Monday.\\n\\n“We will allow people from any state if they have obtained a travel pass,” medical education minister K Sudhakar said. \\n\\nThe decision to impose travel restrictions follows the recent arrival of a large number of people from Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu.\\n\\nScores of those returning from the affected states tested positive in quarantine, leading to a spike in the number of infections in the state. “Some 60% to 70% positive cases reported in Karnataka in the past week have had travel history to these states,” Sudhakar said.\\n\\nHome minister Basavaraj Bommai said the government was on high alert about people coming from these states because of an alarming rise in the number of cases in Karnataka.\\n\\n\\nDownloadThe Times of India News App for Latest India NewsSubscribeStart Your Daily Mornings with Times of India Newspaper!

The first coronavirus vaccine to be tested on people in the US appears to be safe and able to stimulate an immune response against the virus, its manufacturer, Moderna announced on Monday. The findings are based on results from the first eight people who each received two doses of the vaccine, starting in March.\\n\\n\\n\\nThose people, healthy volunteers, made antibodies that were then tested in human cells in the lab and were able to stop the virus from replicating — the key requirement for an effective vaccine. The levels of those socalled neutralising antibodies matched the levels found in patients who had recovered after contracting the virus. Moderna has said the second phase involving 600 people will begin soon, and a third phase to begin in July involving thousands of healthy people. TheFDA gave Moderna the go-ahead for the phase II earlier this month.\\n\\n\\nTrump says he's taking malaria drug in case he gets coronavirusPresident Donald Trump said Monday that he is taking a malaria drug to lessen symptoms should he get the new coronavirus, even though the drug is unproven for fighting Covid-19. Trump told reporters he has been taking the drug, hydroxychloroquine, and a zinc supplement daily “for about a week and a half now.”\\n\\nIf those trials go well, a vaccine could be available for widespread use by the end of this year or early 2021, said the firm’s chief medical officer Tal Zaks.\\n\\nThree doses of the vaccine were tested: low, medium and high. These initial results are based on tests of the low and medium doses. The only adverse effect at those doses was redness and soreness in one patient’s arm where the shot was given. But at the highest dose, three patients had fever, muscles and headaches, Zaks said, adding that the symptoms went away after a day.\\n\\n\\nMore on Covid-19\\n\\nCoronavirus pandemic: Complete Coverage\\nLockdown 4.0: What's allowed and what's not in the three zones\\nIt's time to mask up and stay safe: Join TOI's #MaskIndia campaign\\nMHA's guidelines for home isolation\\nTrust the newspaper for your daily verified news\\n\\nBut the high dose is being eliminated from future studies, not so much because of the side effects but because the lower doses appeared to work so well that the high dose is not needed. “Lower the dose, the more vaccine we’ll be able to make,” Zaks said.

Seven government medical institutions are currently testing an average of 2,000 samples a day.\\n\\nIn neighbouring Jharkhand, the same pattern of migrant workers accounting for the bulk of new cases seems to be emerging, although the size of its basket is only a fraction of Bihar’s.\\n\\nAround 4pm on May 10, officials in Hazaribag had called a news conference to announce that all three Covid-19 patients in the district had recovered and there was no new case in 20 days. Hazaribag was to be declared a green zone the next day, they said. Hours later, a migrant returnee tested positive. Over the next week, 22 more cases followed.\\n\\nNeighbouring Garhwa had seen this play out two days before. It had been on track to become an orange zone till the morning of May 8. The district’s three Covid-19 patients had recovered and no one else had tested positive in 10 days. By midnight, 20 people tested positive in one go. All of them had returned from other states.\\n\\nWhen the Covid-19 outbreak started, Ranchi was Jharkhand's hotspot. The epicentre has since shifted. Ranchi has just 20 active cases now. The rural districts have 87.\\n\\nMany of the migrant workers who are back came from red zones in Gujarat, Karnataka, Telangana and Maharashtra. The country’s first Shramik Special train brought workers from Hyderabad to Ranchi on May 1. By May 17, more than 62,000 had returned by 52 special trains. Another 30,000-odd arrived by bus from neighbouring states.\\n\\n“With thousands still returning home every day, we do not have the infrastructure to put all of them in institutional quarantine,” principal health secretary Dr Nitin Madan Kulkarni said.\\n\\n“The state has just four facilities to test samples and none in the districts that are now witnessing a spike. All samples have to be sent to Ranchi, Jamshedpur and Dhanbad. It sometimes takes days, even weeks, to get a report,” said Gurjeet Singh, state convener of the Public Health Foundation of India. Of the 37,000 samples collected in the state, only 975 are from Giridih and the reports of 381 (40%) are pending. Koderma has collected 802 samples. Garhwa is slightly better off with 1,268 (232 results pending). Hazaribag (2,064 samples collected) and Palamu (3,600 samples) are comparatively better, but still too little.\\n\\nThe worst, public health experts said, is still to come. “The incubation period of the virus is at least 14 days, so the real picture will be known only by the end of the month,” Bagodar MLA Vinod Singh said.\\n\\n\\nDownloadThe Times of India News App for Latest India NewsSubscribeStart Your Daily Mornings with Times of India Newspaper!

More in this reportadvertisement\\n\\n  Prabhash K Dutta    New DelhiMay 19, 2020UPDATED: May 19, 2020 13:04 IST  A stranded pilgrim is being thermal screened at Ajmer in Rajasthan before boarding a train for Uttar Pradesh on May 17. (Photo: PTI)HIGHLIGHTSOlder people and men are more vulnerable to novel coronavirus infectionObesity and kidney ailments make people susceptible to Covid-19 than other co-morbiditiesHigh population density and social deprivation help Covid-19 spread fasterThe novel coronavirus has travelled from one part of the world to the rest largely anonymously. Anybody can be a novel coronavirus patient. But some groups are now understood to be more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, the new virus that causes Covid-19, a disease that aggravates co-morbid complications.A study published in The Lancet has identified seven factors that make a person more prone to contract a novel coronavirus infection. These are increasing age, being men, social deprivation, cramped living or high population density, obesity, chronic kidney disease and also ethnicity.OLD AND MEN: AGEING MEN AT RISKThe study found that adults were at increased risk compared to children. People aged 40-64 years were more at risk compared to younger adults. Old age people -- 75 years and older -- were at the greatest risk of contracting the novel coronavirus, the researchers found.The prevalence of coronavirus infection was found in less than 5 per cent among those below the age of 18, and almost four times as high in people aged 40 years and older. Clinical experience worldwide shows that the older people are at increased risk of serious or fatal illness due to coronavirus infection.The Lancet study also confirmed previous research showing that Covid-19 affected men more than women. This difference is more marked among people aged 30-65 years. Around half of cases, examined for this study, were of those older than 50 years.OBESITY AND KIDNEYSCovid-19 has been found to aggravate pre-existing conditions. Doctors have found people with previous heart, lungs and kidney conditions to be more risk-prone in the case of coronavirus infection.The study, however, found kidney ailment and obesity as conditions for increased contractibility of novel coronavirus infection. It says, \"Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection could be different, and we found no evidence of an association between these conditions [hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease] and a positive SARS-CoV-2 test.\"\"We found that chronic kidney disease and obesity were associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Both chronic kidney disease and obesity have been associated with increased risk of other respiratory infections,\" the researchers said in a key differentiating finding.CRAMPING, DEPRIVATIONSARS-CoV-2 transmission is known to be associated with high population density due to increased social mixing. The study found that urban areas are more prone to coronavirus infection than rural areas. The researchers explained that this could be due to more people sharing smaller spaces such as studio flats or higher single-room occupancy.They surprisingly \"did not find an association between increased household size and risk of SARS-CoV-2 positivity, despite a previously reported higher risk of transmission among household contacts.\" This means a big family can be less vulnerable compared to a small family if it has enough space to maintain social-physical distancing.The prevalence of novel coronavirus in Mumbai, Delhi, Goa and Arunachal Pradesh corroborates the findings of the study about population densitySocial deprivation emerged as another big factor, making people vulnerable to novel coronavirus. The study found that social deprivation is associated with increased risk of other respiratory infections. There is evidence that the risk of Covid-19-related death is higher in more deprived parts of England.\"We found an association between increasing deprivation and increased odds of a positive test, independent of household size, urban location, and smoking,\" the researchers said.ETHNICITY?What has emerged as a surprising conclusion of the coronavirus vulnerability study is ethnicity as a vulnerable factor. It found that though most Covid-19 patients in the UK were white but the blacks and Asians had a higher share in coronavirus pandemic compared to their proportion in the national population.\"An analysis of 3,370 people admitted to intensive care in the UK with confirmed Covid-19 found that 402 (11·9 per cent) were black, 486 (14·4 per cent) were Asian, and 2,236 (66·4 per cent) were white, compared with respective national figures of 3·3 per cent, 7·5 per cent, and 86·0 per cent [respectively],\" the paper said.While projecting ethnicity as a key vulnerability to novel coronavirus, the researchers have warned about the shortcoming of their study. They have not considered socioeconomic factors such as employment in high-risk positions, education, income, and structural barriers to health care. These are known factors that contribute to increased risk for any disease outbreak.ANDIn another surprise finding, the study said active smokers had half the chance of contracting novel coronavirus than those who have never smoked.Read | Covid Toes among kids: New symptom of novel coronavirus infectionAlso read | Early trials for Covid vaccine show promiseAlso read | Scientists in China believe new drug can stop pandemic \\'without vaccine\\'IndiaToday.in has plenty of useful resources that can help you better understand the coronavirus pandemic and protect yourself.

This sudden surge in Covid numbers has forced the Centre to evaluate, review, and redraft their strategy again.advertisement\\n\\n  Snehanshu Shekhar  New DelhiMay 19, 2020UPDATED: May 19, 2020 10:18 IST  More than 5,000 cases were reported on Monday. (Photo: PTI)HIGHLIGHTSThis sudden surge in Covid numbers has forced the Centre to evaluate, review, and redraft their strategy againIn the last two days, the government has updated its containment plan for large outbreaksAssessment of the health ministry is that only 30 municipal areas are contributing 80 per cent of Covid numbers in several statesAs country witnessed its biggest ever spike on Sunday with more than 5,000 cases being reported in a single day, it seems that worst is far from over. Though the health ministry officials are saying that numbers may continue with similar trends in the coming days, earlier assessment of AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria that the country may witness its peak in June/July is still haunting several minds. Going by the health ministry\\'s indication, all planning and resources are being mobilized to handle that impending situation.First, it was the Tablighi Jamaat event and now a large scale of migration is giving a headache to the receiving states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Jharkhand, and West Bengal. UP and Bihar are the big receivers of migrants till now. UP alone received more than 7.60 lakh migrant labourers through 541 Shramik trains, forget about other modes of movements.This sudden surge in Covid numbers has forced the Centre to evaluate, review, and redraft their strategy again. Even ICMR has changed its testing guidelines.In the last two days, the government has updated its containment plan for large outbreaks. Assessment of the health ministry is that only 30 municipal areas are contributing 80 per cent of Covid numbers in states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana. Therefore, the government machinery is also gearing up for the containment of the large outbreaks, which includes:Large outbreak defined as an area where there are 15 or more casesGo for geographic quarantine which means near-absolute interruption of movement of people to and from a relatively large define geographic areaA barrier erected around the focus of infectionTo apply strict perimeter controlActive search of cases, early isolation, contact listing and tracking, quarantine and follow-up of contactsTesting all suspect cases, symptomatic contacts, asymptomatic direct, high-risk contacts of a confirmed caseClinical management based on the risk profileUnder perimeter control, the establishment of entry and exit points to be strictly maintainedNo movement to be allowed except for medical emergencies, essential goods, and servicesNo unchecked influx of population to be allowed andPeople transiting to be recordedA new buffer zone has been created in the new MHA guidelines. As per the health ministry, the buffer zone has been delineated around each containment zone and it should be properly defined by the district administration and local urban bodies.The buffer zones will be primarily the areas wherein additional and focused attention is required to check the spread of the coronavirus to adjoining areas. As per the new advisory for effective containment, buffer zones need to be a large area.As per the plan, the activities under the buffer zone include:Enhanced passive surveillance for ILI/SARI through existing integrated disease surveillance programCreate community awareness on preventive measuresCancel all mass gathering event, meeting in public and private placesAvoid public placesThe health ministry also revised its cluster containment strategy. As per reports, to check local transmission, a cluster containment strategy will be initiated with active surveillance in containment zone like:Contact tracing within and outside the containment zonesExpanding lab capacity for testing all suspect samples, close contacts, ILA/ SARIIsolate all suspected and confirmed cases for clinical managementIntensive risk communication apart from strict social distancing and hygieneIdentification of local community volunteers to help in surveillance, contact tracingExtensive inter-personal and community-based communicationInternal assessmentAs per the health ministry, in 2009 during the H1N1 outbreak, it was observed that well connected big cities with substantive population movement were reporting a large number of cases, whereas rural areas and smaller towns with a low population reported only a few cases.But in the case of coronavirus, while the spread of this virus could be high, it\\'s unlikely that it\\'ll be uniformly affecting all parts of the country.But state machineries are also apprehensive that with a large scale of migration since May 1, the threat of the virus spreading in small towns and rural areas may go high. As per the health ministry officials, this calls for a differential approach to a different region of the country, while mounting a strong containment strategy.With a bulk of Covid-19 cases coming from urban settlements, the government has suggested deploying additional manpower in these areas and roping in local political and religious leaders for communicating all aspects of coronavirus prevention measures as residents are \"more inclined to trust them\".It has also decided to identify an \"incident commander\" in urban settlements, who will be tasked with planning, operation, logistics, and finance to implement an Incident Response System. The commander will report to the area municipal commissioner.With the growing coronavirus numbers in 30 municipal areas, a big challenge is more and more testing in these hotspots. As per information, the country also reached the milestone of 1 lakh testing a day. With the country has already conducted more than 22 lakh testing till now, the indication is that India is preparing for 10 lakh testing capacity by July this year. As experts have a different opinion about coronavirus\\'s peak in the country, all preparatory indication shows that the government is readying itself to that big challenge.READ | 2,033 new Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, state\\'s tally crosses 35,000 markREAD | Uddhav Thackeray takes oath as Maharashtra MLC, seals position in govt after weeks of uncertaintyWATCH | Politics and theatrics over migrant crisis; India\\'s total corona cases stand at 96,169; moreIndiaToday.in has plenty of useful resources that can help you better understand the coronavirus pandemic and protect yourself.

But until now, I\\'ve never been scared for my own life,\" he said.Shamim says he alone has dug graves for 115 bodies at the cemetery\\'s designated area for coronavirus dead, about 200 metres away from the others.Despite the third-generation gravedigger\\'s experience, his family has now started complaining about his job at the Jadid Qabristan Ahle Muslim cemetery, and Shamim has moved his four daughters to his parents\\' house to reduce the risk of them catching the disease.\"They are scared. Sometimes I lie to them that I don\\'t touch the bodies,\" said the 38-year-old.Prayers and heartacheShamim gets a call an hour before the hearse arrives. That is when he becomes nervous.He prepares the relatives, asking them to put on protective suits, gloves and masks for the burial ceremony, before the family says a prayer and lowers the corpse -- usually wrapped in cloth or plastic sheeting -- into the grave.The mourners then throw their protective gear into the hole before a mechanical earth-mover fills it in.Some of the bodies of coronavirus victims arrive without relatives to help with the burial, so Shamim said he has often defied orders to stay away.\"People just refuse to come help with the burial. What can you do? I have to step in,\" he said, describing \"heartbreaking\" scenes, like when only a wife and a small child came to the funeral of one man.At a recent burial, Shamim had to find gloves for a small group who had turned up just with plastic bags for protection. He finally found two pairs and gave one glove each to the four people who were lowering the body.\"I understand it\\'s never easy to bury the dead, but some families don\\'t follow the rules at all. So many times I have had to beg the hospital workers who accompany the body for gloves,\" Shamim said.Fear of contagionThe gravedigger has been so worried about the pandemic that he has twice been tested for the coronavirus, and paid for one himself of them despite his meagre wages.He said he has had help from the cemetery management committee and city authorities, but nothing from the government. \"I am way too low for them to bother about.\"With the number of victims growing in Delhi and his services in greater demand, Shamim says he worries now if his breathing changes or he has a stomach upset.\"I always felt safest around the dead and most vulnerable in the outside world. Now I find it difficult to sleep at night,\" he said.READ | Will remember how they treated us: Migrant workers say cops asked for money to board bus homeALSO READ | Kashmiri labourers in Andhra asked to pay Rs 1.8 lakh for bus ride till station, get help from local businessmenWATCH | Migrants clash with police in AhmedabadIndiaToday.in has plenty of useful resources that can help you better understand the coronavirus pandemic and protect yourself.

Congress has termed the decision as impractical.advertisement\\n\\n  Rahul Noronha  BhopalMay 18, 2020UPDATED: May 18, 2020 07:53 IST  Congress has termed the decision as impractical. (Rep photo: PTI)The decision by the Madhya Pradesh health department asking its field staff to refer patients with 21 signs -- anxiety, nausea, headache among others -- to dedicated coronavirus treatment facilities has run into a controversy with the opposition Congress claiming that it would spread the virus further and add to the number of positive cases in the state.In a letter dated May 15, Principal Secretary, Health, Faiz Ahmed Kidwai wrote to all collectors and chief medical and health officers. The letter stated that the coronavirus suspected and positive cases are not being admitted to dedicated Covid hospitals on the basis of their symptoms.It also asked the doctors to refer the patients exhibiting 21 listed symptoms to dedicated coronavirus hospitals.The principal secretary listed the 21 symptoms that also include the ones other than the regular symptoms such as fever, dry cough, breathlessness, and sore throat.The symptoms are headache, muscle pain, cold, nausea and anxiety, cough with sputum, shivers, reduction in the ability to taste and smell, cramping in hands and feet, swelling in hands and feet, swelling in thigh muscles, localized pain, issues in walking, chest pain, redness and blackening of the skin, bluishness and blackening of the skin, shoulder pain and weakness in hands and feet.Interestingly, saans mein taqleef (a problem in breathing) is listed as the symptom number 3 and saans lene main taqleef hona (again, the problem in breathing) is also listed as symptom number 21.It is not specified where the list of symptoms has been taken from. While at most places the word \\'refer\\' has been used, the word \\'admit\\' has been used in the subject line of the letter which made Congress question the decision.Congress spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta termed the decision as impractical.\"There are about 440 corona dedicated treatment centres and none of them is equipped to handle the rush of people with the listed 21 symptoms if they start coming. Also, the clubbing of Covid-19 positive patients with those with regular fever will result in further spread of the disease,\" he said.IndiaToday.in has plenty of useful resources that can help you better understand the coronavirus pandemic and protect yourself.

(PTI photo from Coimbatore following a storm)Personnel of the NDRF were deployed on Sunday in West Bengal and Odisha, which said it was ready to undertake massive evacuation of 11 lakh people likely to be severely hit by the cyclone \\'Amphan\\', officials said.The cyclone, according to an IMD report, has intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm over the Bay of Bengal. It is likely to make landfall somewhere between Digha in West Bengal and Hatiya Islands in Bangladesh on Wednesday.\"The trajectory is mostly towards West Bengal, Sagar Islands and probably towards Bangladesh.... But we have to watch the trajectory very closely. NDRF has deployed the teams well in advance. They are either deployed or moving towards the destination,\" S N Pradhan, the chief of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) said in New Delhi.LISTED ARE 10 DEVELOPMENTS ON CYCLONE AMPHAN1. As cyclone Amphan rolls in towards the Indian shores ominously, it is likely to unleash heavy rain and high-velocity winds in large swathes of coastal Odisha and West Bengal.2. It is likely to cross West Bengal-Bangladesh coasts between Sagar Islands in West Bengal and Hatiya islands in Bangladesh between afternoon and evening of May 20 as a very severe cyclonic storm, Regional MeT Director in Kolkata GK Das said.3. Odisha, which has been ravaged by a string of cyclones over the last few years, including the cyclone Fani last year, has made arrangements to shift 11 lakh people from vulnerable areas, Special Relief Commissioner (SRC) PK Jena said.4. On Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik\\'s direction, the district collectors of Ganjam, Gajapti, Puri, Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapara, Bhadrak, Balasore, Mayurbhanj, Jajpur, Cuttack, Khurda and Nayagarh have been asked to remain alert.5. Special relief commissioner said of the 809 cyclone shelters in the 12 coastal districts, 242 are currently being used as temporary medical camps for the returnees from different states amid the Covid-19 lockdown.\"We have 567 cyclone and flood shelters available to house the people in case evacuation is required. In addition, we have arranged 7,092 buildings to keep people if required,\" Jena said.6. The railways said the AC special trains between New Delhi and Bhubaneswar will be diverted for four days from Monday. The trains will travel on diverted route via Bhubaneswar-Angul-Sambalpur City-Jharsuguda-Rourkela-Tata route, bypassing Bhadrak-Balasore-Hijli track during the period.7. Arrangements have already been made to restore power, water supply, clear roads, start rescue and relief operations immediately after the cyclone impact subsides in the state.8. Under its impact, the coastal districts of Gangetic West Bengal, including North and South 24 Parganas, Kolkata, East and West Midnapore, Howrah and Hooghly are likely to experience light to moderate rain at many places with heavy downpour at isolated places on May 19.9. Seven teams of NDRF have been deployed in South 24 Parganas, North 24 Parganas, East Midnapore, West Midnapore, Howrah and Hooghly of West Bengal. In Odisha, 10 teams have been deployed in seven districts -- Puri, Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapara, Jajpur, Bhadrak, Balasore and Mayurbhanj.10. In view of the impending cyclone, the Odisha government will stop road movement for three days from the evening of May 18 to May 20. The district collectors have been asked to direct the border checkposts not to allow entry of anyone during the period.Amphan, which is in the category of a very severe cyclonic storm, is most likely to intensify into an extremely severe cyclonic storm by Monday evening attaining a maximum wind speed of 170 to 180 kmph gusting to 200 kmph, Das said.

(PTI file photo)Amid the staff crunch at the city\\'s private hospitals in the wake of the recent exodus of nurses, most medical facilities in Kolkata have decided to cater to a limited number of patients, and counsel the existing employees to prevent them from following suit.Over 350 nurses have quit jobs at private hospitals in Kolkata and left for their homes in Manipur and other parts of the country, notwithstanding the spurt in Covid-19 cases.A senior official of Peerless Hospital in south Kolkata, which is currently short of 25 nurses, said the number of patients admitted would be in proportion to the total beds available.\"The number of admissions will be restricted as we have to make do with the existing staff. It seems those that left are not going to come back anytime soon. As of now, we have to wait patiently. Nurses cannot be produced overnight,\" Peerless Hospital Managing Director (MD) Dr Sujit Kar Purkayastha told PTI.At AMRI, one of the designated Covid-19 hospitals in Bengal, the authorities are counselling the staff members to prevent them from leaving. At least 77 nurses from the hospital have left for their hometowns in other states.AMRI CEO Rupak Barua said assurances have been given to the staff members that their concerns would be addressed.\"We are talking to our employees and addressing their problems. We are planning to rope in those who have retired,\" Barua said.Prashant Sharma, the MD of Charnock Hospital, said the management was having a difficult time making a fresh roster.\"This is the problem with almost all private hospitals. Nurses from Manipur, Odisha and Tripura, who had been working for us all this while, are suddenly leaving. Those from Bengal, Kerala and other south Indian states are still here, we will have to make a revised roster.\"The east Kolkata hospital, which had shut its doors for a few weeks after one person, who had gone there for dialysis, tested positive for Covid-19, reopened on May 14 with only 35 beds.Sharma said that he fears the problem might aggravate over the next few weeks, and suggested that the state take immediate steps to address the issue.A senior official of Bhagirathi Neotia Woman and Child Care Centre, where more than 50 Manipuri nurses have stopped reporting for work since last week, said, \"We knew this was coming. We had heard whispers. Most of them have left without submitting resignations.\"As of now the patient footfall is low, and the hospital is coping with the crisis somehow, he said.\"Once the lockdown is revoked, we have no idea how to deal with the staff shortage. None of these nurses are available on phones. They have switched off their phones. The ones still there are working overtime...\" he said.Other private facilities in the city facing a similar predicament include R N Tagore Hospital, Medica, IRIS Multispeciality Hospital, Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals Limited, AMRI hospital, Fortis Healthcare Limited, Charnock Hospital and Belle Vue.A nurse who left for Manipur, earlier in the week, said safety concerns and parental pressure were the two main reasons due to which she quit her job.Association of Hospitals of Eastern India, a non- statutory body comprising 17 private facilities in Kolkata as members, has written to Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha seeking his intervention for resolving the crisis.In his letter, Pradeep Lal Mehta, the president of the association, said, \"Although the exact reason why they are leaving is not known, we have found out from nurses still on duty that the state government of Manipur is offering them lucrative stipend upon returning home.\"Taking to Facebook, however, Manipur Chief Minister Nongthombam Biren Singh rubbished the claim and said, \"No such advisory has been issued by the state. We are not asking anybody to return. We feel proud of them as they serve the patients in Calcutta, Delhi and Chennai.\"Sources in the health department said the government has sought information on nurses, including their place of origin, from different hospitals here.READ | Bengal shocker: Govt hospital cremates Covid victim, family gets news 4 days later | ExclusiveREAD | Bihar man dies after Kolkata hospital refuses treatment over suspicion of coronavirusREAD | West Bengal: Two-year-old cancer patient dies due to lack of treatment amid Covid-19 crisisIndiaToday.in has plenty of useful resources that can help you better understand the coronavirus pandemic and protect yourself.

(File picture for representation: PTI)Two policemen died while three others suffered grievous injuries on Sunday after an encounter with Maoists in Gadchiroli district of Maharashtra.The encounter broke out in the jungles of Poyarkoti Koparshi at the Bhamragad sub division of Gadchiroli district when an anti-Naxal operation was being carried out by QRT (Quick Response Team) and Special Operation Commandos jointly.Around 6 am on Sunday, the Gadchiroli police team came under attack by Maoists. Police commandoes retaliated and the encounter went on for over two to three hours. Maoists initially carried out a landmine blast and lobbed grenades and fired at the police team.Police Sub Inspector Dhanaji Honmane and Constable Kishor Atram along with three other jawans identified as Gonglu Oksa Raju Pusli, and Dasru Kurchami suffered grievous bullet injuries in the attack. A chopper was flown from the district headquarters for evacuation of the injured from the spot to Gadchiroli.

(Image for representation: PTI)HIGHLIGHTSGovt to identify incident commander in urban areasDevised plan for settlements with poor living conditionsCoordination committee will be formed under incident commanderWith a bulk of novel coronavirus cases coming from urban settlements, the government has suggested deploying additional manpower in these areas and roping in local political and religious leaders for communicating all aspects of coronavirus disease prevention measures as residents are \"more inclined to trust them\".It has also decided to identify an \"incident commander\" in urban settlements, who will be tasked with planning, operation, logistics and finance to implement an Incident Response System. The commander will report to the area municipal commissioner.In a document, the health ministry said these settlements in cities have poor living conditions and are often overcrowded, with many people crammed into very small living spaces. And hence physical distancing, isolation and communicating the risk of infectious respiratory diseases -- such as Covid-19 -- to the dwellers could be challenging.So the Urban Local Bodies need to prepare for responding to any possible outbreak.The document, a set of guidelines for preparedness and response to Covid-19 in urban settlements, outlined steps to do it and setting up an Incident Response System and engaging community leaders were part of the measures.\"Community groups are key to creating awareness on Covid among these populations. Use of local (political, religious and opinion) leaders for communicating all aspects of the Covid prevention and control is vital as dwellers are more inclined to trust them,\" it said.The trained manpower available on www.covidwarriors.gov.in will be contacted for their readiness to deployment at short notice.The document said a coordination committee will be formed under the leadership of the \"incident commander\" and would comprise representatives from departments like health, women and child development, elected representatives and NGOs already serving the area. The guidelines called for all risk-communication intervention to address psycho-social and stigma issues, particularly in local languages, and to put up posters outside community toilets and water points, and use of cable TV channels to create awareness.Social media should be used with appropriate messages to target these population and for refuting fake news. Community groups should also popularise adoption of Aarogya Setu application, it said.The document was released on Saturday as Health Secretary Preeti Sudan, Rajesh Bhushan, OSD, Health Ministry, and other senior officers held a review meeting with principal health secretaries, municipal commissioners, DMs and other officials from the 30 municipal areas contributing almost 80 per cent of the country\\'s Covid-19 cases.These 30 municipal areas are BrihanMumbai, Pune, Kolkata, Jaipur, Nashik, Jodhpur, Agra, Greater Chennai, Ahmedabad, Thane, all Delhi MCs, Indore, Howrah, Kurnool, Bhopal, Amritsar, Villupuram, Vadodara, Udaipur, Tiruvallur, Aurangabad, Cuddalore, Greater Hyderabad, Surat, Chengalpattu, Ariyalur, Palghar, Berhampur, Solapur and Meerut.The guidelines further said the surveillance system will be strengthened in these areas and a strict perimeter control will be maintained in containment zones with Section 144 enforced to ensure people remain in their dwelling units.The document acknowledged the disease surveillance system in most cities or towns is not as well organised as in rural areas and this is more pronounced in urban settlements.According to the 2011 Census, there are 2,613 towns/cities with such settlements. Nearly 6.54 crore people reside in 1.39 crore households in these areas, representing 17.4 of all urban population.The Health Ministry has also brought out two updated containment plan documents: one for large outbreaks (15 or more cases), and one for others.According to the plan for large outbreaks, a geographic quarantine or near absolute interruption of movement of people will be applicable to such areas and strict perimeter control in containment zones will be applied with an active search for cases through physical house-to-house surveillance.The plan, however, said a number of variables determine the success of the containment strategy through geographic quarantine such as number and size of clusters, the effectiveness of geographic quarantine, how efficiently the virus is transmitting, taking into account environmental factors like temperature and humidity, public health response in terms of active case finding, testing of a large number of cases, immediate isolation of suspect and confirmed cases and quarantine of contacts.ALSO READ | Coronavirus: Maharashtra govt extends lockdown till May 31 as cases cross 30,000-markAlso Read | Rs 40,000 crore increase in allocation for MGNREGA: Nirmala SitharamanAlso Watch | Can Nirmala Sitharaman\\'s booster shots boost economy?IndiaToday.in has plenty of useful resources that can help you better understand the coronavirus pandemic and protect yourself.

Having walked hundreds of kilometers, the migrant labourers have lost count of the distance they have covered. All they wish right now is to reach home. Alive.advertisement\\n\\n  Manogya Loiwal     KolkataMay 17, 2020UPDATED: May 17, 2020 15:24 IST  72-year-old Kapil Dev Singh, who is walking to his native town in Bihar from Telangana. (Photo: India Today/Manogya Loiwal)Seventy-two-year-old Kapil Dev Singh is sitting on the highway, sipping water to quench his thirst as the scorching sun rips him apart with the heat and sweat.After walking more than 1,000 km at this age, he has forgotten how much distance he has covered in the last five days of his journey from Telengana to Bengal. Even though, he has travelled more than 1,400 km, lost all his savings, a hard 600-km journey is still left before he can reach his home in Bihar.Kapil Dev had been working as a cook and doubling up for miscellaneous work at a rice mill in Khammam area of Telangana. The mill stopped operations during the lockdown and the workers were left to fend for themselves.For more than a week he, along with his other workers from different parts of eastern India, have reached out to the administration only to receive no response. It was after a fortnight of local struggle that they decided to begin the journey to their homes on foot.They left all their belongings, sold whatever they could to get some cash and left Telangana with a heavy heart.\"I have been walking for five-six days. The only option I have is to walk until I reach home. if you ask me how many kilometers I have walked, I have left keeping a track of it now. I am told we have travelled 1,400 km till now. My only fault is that I am poor. I will get food only till I work, so, I was not getting anything in my workplace. I am so poor that I cannot buy food also. I only know I have to reach Khagaria near Bhagalpur somehow, alive,\" a distraught Kapil Dev Singh said.Many like Kapil Dev are walking on highways in an effort to reach home.Another labourer, Saheb Mullick, also narrated his ordeal: \"My factory had shut, however, the state government said they will provide food. Bur, there was only one meal a day. In fact, the food and water given to us was so bad in quality that we would fall sick.\"I have wasted days standing in queues to get a token but nothing happened. Police dispersed us. The locals even treated us like dogs and shooed us away saying \"Bhag yahaan se! [Run away from here].\"Anarul Sheikh, a resident of Mushidabad said, \"We started on May 8 and now we are entering the 10th day of walking. We have been walking nonstop and eating like beggars. Whatever we get to eat. We do not have money to even hire a vehicle and reach home. Our family is now worried about whether we are safe and alive. We have nothing left. We used to work with carpenters and assist them. We had no work for more than one month. We kept asking administration and they said they will let us know. They said police will go to our rooms and inform us but nothing happened. The food was given only once a day. We have already walked around 1,000 km and there is no strength left in me to walk any further. I have no money to even buy a cup of tea or a packet of biscuit.\"With factories shutting down and no future guarantee, these labourers are walking back home. According to a latest order, the migrant workers must be provided vehicles to return their hometowns and should not be seen on highways, hence, police and political leaders are now seen at various checkpoints arranging vehicles for them.Tufaan Kabiraj, a resident of Nadia district returning from Telangana said, \"We are begging, borrowing and requesting people for some food and money. Our condition is worse than street dogs. I don\\'t know what sin my ancestors or I have committed that we are having to go through this.\"Many are walking knowing that this will end soon even if they do not know how soon.READ | 25 migrant workers killed as 2 trucks collide in UP\\'s Auraiya; Yogi suspends 2 officialsALSO READ | Rahul Gandhi meets migrants in Delhi, Congress claims labourers taken into custody, police denyALSO READ | Lockdown 4.0 Guidelines: Here is how fourth phase is expected to be differentALSO WATCH | Maha leader Anil Deshmukh on migrant crisis; Inside virus-hit Dharavi; moreIndiaToday.in has plenty of useful resources that can help you better understand the coronavirus pandemic and protect yourself.

One of them has been identified as Tahir Ahmad Bhat, a \\'wanted\\' Hizbul terrorist, from Kashmir\\'s Pulwama.He was an associate of slain Hizb commander Haroon Abbas Wani from Doda district.How the operation took place On Saturday midnight, cops in Kashmir Zone Police gave \"technical input\" of the presence of two terrorists in a house in Dora district.The exact location of the terrorists was shared after the security forces laid a cordon surrounding many houses present in the area.The security forces at first faced difficulty as local residents came out of their houses. Tahir and his associate hid their weapons and came out like several others.Sensing that this could be an opportunity for a terrorist to slip away, all residents were asked to go back to their home. A house to house search was then carried out.This is when an Army jawan entered the suspected house, the two terrorists took out weapons that they had hidden in the trunk and shot at him. The Army personnel later succumbed to his injuries.Later, one of the terrorists were killed by the security forces.Director General (DG) Dilbagh Singh lauded the team involved in operations.\"On a specific police input, an operation was launched late last night in Doda district. We had specific intelligence after from Central Zone (of Kashmir) police. Immediately the cordon was laid. Unfortunately, Army personnel was killed when a joint team of security forces launched a house to house search,\" Director General (DG) Dilbagh Singh said.Who is Tahir Ahmad BhatTahir Ahmad Bhat, one of the slain Hizbul terrorist, was part of the module which killed right-wing leaders in the region.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday filed a charge sheet against six people, including three slain Hizbul Mujahideen (HM) terrorists and three arrested overground workers of the terror group, for providing support to Pakistan-based terrorists to kill BJP leader Anil Parihar and his brother Ajeet Parihar in Jammu’s Kishtwar. Tahir was suspected to be part of the same module.After four days of Tahir\\'s joining in terror-outfit Hizbhul, RSS leader Chanderkant Sharma and his PSO was attacked and killed in Kishtwar on April, 2019.Tahir is wanted in this murder case and also March 2019 Banihal IED case which is currently being probed by NIA.ALSO READ | Decrease in number of local youths joining militancy: J-K DGPALSO WATCH | Hizbul commander gunned down in Kashmir encounterIndiaToday.in has plenty of useful resources that can help you better understand the coronavirus pandemic and protect yourself.

The 70-year-old truck driver tested positive for coronavirus on May 2, as seen in his report from Delhi\\'s Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital.However, the death summary by Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital does not mention coronavirus as the reason for death and says that death was caused by cardiopulmonary arrest.The doctor\\'s summary said the 70-year-old patient was brought from RML Hospital to RGSSH via ambulance at around 4:10 pm. It added that the patient was gasping and pulse and blood pressure were not recordable.\"Then immediately CPR was started according to ACLs guidelines for half and hour but patient could not be revived and ECG showed a flat line.

The top five states in this tally include Madhya Pradesh (30), Telangana (22), Maharashtra (19) and Punjab (17). The most common factor for these road crashes was speeding,\" SaveLife Foundation CEO Piyush Tewari told PTI.As the numbers spiralled, slowly, steadily and then in what appeared to be a torrent, a pattern emerged. Many of the tragedies occurred in the dark, which is when it is cooler to walk, and many people were caught in their sleep.That\\'s what happened on Saturday too, when a trailer rammed into a stationary truck in the pre-dawn darkness around 3.30 am on a highway near Auraiya in Uttar Pradesh, killing at least 24 people and injuring 36. The vehicles, one headed from Delhi to Madhya Pradesh and the other to Rajasthan, were ferrying labourers to their homes,Some of the workers had stopped for tea and others were possibly sleeping by the roadside or in the vehicles when the crash occurred. Most of those killed were from Jharkhand and West Bengal, and some from Kushinagar in eastern Uttar Pradesh, officials said as reports suggested that some of the victims may have been crushed under cement bags loaded in one of the vehicles.A few hours later, tragedy unfolded in Sagar, Madhya Pradesh, when five migrant workers going from Maharashtra to Uttar Pradesh were killed when a truck carrying them overturned on the Sagar-Kanpur Road.The combination of no traffic and speeding vehicles has led to havoc, endangering the lives of those who found themselves without work or money in the coronavirus-induced lockdown and were frantic to get home, any which way.Over this week alone, there have been multiple accidents reported from Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.In Guna, Madhya Pradesh, for instance, as many as 14 migrants were killed and around 60 injured in two different road accidents on Thursday and Friday.On Friday, six migrant workers were killed and 95 injured in separate road accidents across Uttar Pradesh.And the day before, six migrant workers walking from Punjab to Bihar were killed in Muzaffarnagar in the state when they were hit by a roadways bus on the Delhi-Saharanpur Highway, officials said.With no compass to guide them on their treacherous inter-state journey home and perhaps to escape the police, many people also walk along railway tracks.On May 8, it cost 16 lives.In perhaps the most gruesome of accidents, 16 migrant workers going to Madhya Pradesh were mowed down by freight train when they dozed off on the tracks near Aurangabad in Maharashtra.In a chilling reflection of the hunger and deprivation that led the group of 20 men working in a steel unit in Jalna - four of them survived - the \\'rotis\\' they had packed to see them through the journey lay scattered on the tracks.The same morning, hundreds of kilometres away, a migrant labourer couple, Krishna Sahu (45) and his wife Pramila (40), were run over by an unidentified vehicle on their way from Lucknow to Chhattisgarh. The couple, on a bicycle, were with their two children, both under five years, who survived the crash.Reduced to statistics as they undertake their own personal odysseys, challenging the odds but not always triumphing them, there was a back story everywhere.Some lockdown induced road accidents were reported as early as March 28 when four migrants were run over by a truck on the Maharashtra-Gujarat border. According to Indian Express, the four, part of a group of seven which wanted to reach their villages in Rajasthan after crossing into Gujarat, had just begun walking after taking some rest when a truck came from behind and rammed into them.Two days later, 40-year-old labourer Sukh Lal Ahirwar died in Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh after a car hit him. Ahirwar and his wife had walked for two straight days from Delhi towards their home in Tikamgarh in Madhya Pradesh and were resting on a road divider when the accident took place, reported the Hindi daily Nayi Duniya.Those who survive have no option but continue the journey.Like the group of 20 labourers who left in a tempo from Mumbai to Lucknow on May 10.The 1,400-km journey had barely begun when the tempo met with an accident, killing their driver.The driver had spoken to the news channel NDTV just hours earlier.\"There are lots of problems. We don\\'t have anything to eat. We had rations till now, so we were eating that. Now, we are heading out. We will travel somehow in this,\" one of those in the group told the channel.There were also reports of a woman and her six-year-old daughter who were part of a group travelling between Maharashtra and Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh in an autorickshaw.They had travelled almost 1,300 km when the autorickshaw was hit by a truck just short of their destination in Fatehpur.The Railways has organised \"Shramik Special trains\" and ferried at least 12 lakh migrants to their homes since May 1.\"To bring back the workers till date, the Railways has operated 1,034 Shramik Special trains. Out of which 106 were operated yesterday (Friday). Uttar Pradesh and Bihar has taken steps positively and 80 per cent of the total Shramik Special trains have been operated by these two states,\" Union minister Piyush Goyal tweeted on Saturday.But if the thousands of workers and their families still trudging their way home, however they can, is any indication, it might be too little too late.India accounts for one of the highest road crashes fatalities in the world with an estimated 1.5 lakh people killed in about five lakh accidents a year.READ | Lockdown 4.0 Guidelines: Here is how fourth phase is expected to be differentALSO READ | Andhra Pradesh govt to start intrastate buses for migrant workersALSO WATCH: Coronavirus cases in India cross 80,000IndiaToday.in has plenty of useful resources that can help you better understand the coronavirus pandemic and protect yourself.

I am quite sure divinity would rescue devotees from the coronavirus after joint prayers,\" he told reporters here.He said the closure of temples and shrines has widened the distance between gods and devotees, and the separation cannot be erased through prayers at home.He said though the portals of \\'Char Dham\\' temples have been opened in Uttarakhand, entry of devotees has been banned. \"The deities provide solace to a disturbed mind,\" he said and demanded that devotees be allowed there.The opening of the temples under a guideline would also provide some financial support to priests who have been badly hit by the coronavirus-triggered lockdown.The organisation has requested the prime minister to bring priests and \\'pandas\\' (religious guides) under the umbrella of an economic package being provided by the government to different categories of people.A copy of the letter has been sent to Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Pathak said.The lockdown was first announced by Prime Minister Modi on March 24 for 21 days in a bid to combat the coronavirus pandemic.

      "[{'text': \" \\nIt wasn’t that long ago that Venezuela, which possesses the world’s largest crude oil reserves, was a relatively stable democracy with one of Latin America’s fastest-rising economies. \\nIt was a nation so awash in petroleum revenues that the socialist government of the late former President Hugo Chavez spent huge amounts on social programs and, at one point, even provided free heating oil for impoverished Americans. \\nBut starting in 2014, the South American nation began suffering a startling collapse. \\nWith Venezuela’s gross domestic product plummeting even more than the United States during the Great Depression, many of its nearly 32 million inhabitants became unable to afford food, and resource-starved hospitals did not have enough soap and antibiotics. \\nMeanwhile, Venezuela’s political system spiraled into turmoil. President Nicolás Maduro, whose 2018 reelection was tainted by accusations of irregularities and voter intimidation, faced massive street protests and survived a spring 2019 military uprising instigated by opposition politician Juan Guaido, leader of the elected National Assembly whose legislative powers were taken away by Maduro’s regime in 2017. \\nHow is it that Venezuela sank so far in such a short time? Scholars who’ve studied the country say its rise and fall was caused by a combination of factors. “Venezuela has long been dependent on oil revenues, and the Bolivarian revolution of Hugo Chavez did not fundamentally alter that situation,” explains Jo-Marie Burt, an associate professor of political science and Latin American Studies at the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University. \\n“The decline of oil prices, the massive social spending of the Chavez and Maduro governments, U.S. sanctions, and a combination of economic mismanagement and corruption at the top have contributed to the economic collapse.” \\nVenezuela's crisis has been deepened by U.S. sanctions against the Venezuelan oil industry. In March, it also sanctioned the Venezuelan gold mining industry, and in April, it also imposed sanctions against the Central Bank of Venezuela, cutting off that institution's access to U.S. currency and limiting its ability to conduct international transactions, to put even more pressure upon Maduro's regime. Here are some of the key moments in that saga. \\nAn undated photograph of the derricks in Maracaibo oil fields in Venezuela. An undated photograph of the derricks in Maracaibo oil fields in Venezuela. 1922: Oil Is Discovered An oil well in the Maracaibo basin of western Venezuela begins gushing 100,000 barrels of oil per day, indicating the massive reserves beneath the nation’s surface. \\nThen-dictator Gen Juan Vicente Gomez allows more than 100 foreign oil companies into Venezuela and, by 1928, Venezuela becomes the world’s second-biggest petroleum exporter. \\nThe influx of oil revenues enriches Venezuela’s military regime, especially after it enacts a 1943 law requiring foreign oil companies to turn over half their profits. But the money only offers a band-aid on the nation’s underlying problems. \\n“Even before the rise of the oil industry Venezuela did not have a highly productive agricultural sector,” says Miguel R. Tinker Salas, professor of Latin American studies and history at Pomona College in California, and author of Venezuela: What Everyone Needs to Know and The Enduring Legacy: Oil, Culture, and Society in Venezuela. \\n“Land was monopolized by a handful of powerful families, infrastructure was lacking and the country lacked a nationally integrated economy.” But, Salas explains, oil and the rise of cities such as Caracas enabled people to flee rural poverty. \\nVenezuelan President Romulo Betancourt, circa 1958. 1958: Venezuela Elects President Betancourt After the overthrow of brutal, corrupt Venezuelan dictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez, the nation’s three political parties agree to the Punto Fijo Pact to accept the results of popular elections, and opposition leader Rómulo Betancourt—widely regarded as the father of Venezuelan democracy—is elected president. \\nBut, as anthropologist Iselin Åsedotter Strønen has written, the power-sharing agreement also helps establish a system in which each of the parties is guaranteed a slice of government ministries, jobs and contracts, and keeps oil revenues in the hands of the government. 1973: OPEC Embargo Brings Billions The OPEC embargo against the U.S. and other countries causes the price of oil to quadruple, and Venezuela becomes the beneficiary. \\nAs billions more flow into the state treasury, its per-capita GDP soars throughout the rest of the decade. \\nTwo years later, Venezuelan President Carlos Andrés Pérez signs a law nationalizing the oil industry, creating a state-owned oil company called owned Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), and compelling foreign companies to give it a 60 percent ownership share in oil projects. \\n1989: IMF Bailout After oil prices plummet due to a glut in the late 1980s, President Perez’s government struggles under the weight of $33 billion in foreign debt. Ultimately, Venezuela is forced to accept an International Monetary Fund bailout and impose austerity measures that result in sharp rises in the prices of consumer goods and fares for public transportation. Protesters take to the streets for demonstrations that turn violent, leading to a nationwide curfew and suspension of civil liberties. \\nHugo Chavez Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez speaking to citizens in 2000 regarding his economic plan. 1998: Hugo Chávez Elected Firebrand populist leader Hugo Chávez, a former lieutenant colonel in the Venezuelan military who six years earlier led a failed coup attempt, is elected president, upending a political establishment that had controlled the nation for decades. \\nOver the next decade and a half, Chavez embarks on a massive social spending binge. “To finance educational, health, food, and housing programs for a population of over 30 million, the government redirected oil profits to address pressing social inequality,” Tinker Salas explains. “Chávez era social programs, which significantly reduced poverty, nonetheless increased dependence on oil.”Though Chavez wanted to diversify the Venezuelan economy, his expensive strategy only increased the dependence upon exported oil. \\nChavez also strives to build Venezuelan influence, providing subsidized oil to Cuba in exchange for the services of Cuban doctors and teachers. He sells oil to other South American countries and China at below-market rates. At the same time, though, Chavez neglects to spend money maintaining oil facilities, and production declines. After Hugo Chávez dies of cancer, he is replaced by his hand-picked successor Nicolás Maduro, who won election by just 1.6 percentage points over opponent Henrique Capriles, who unsuccessfully sought a recount. Muduro soon begins consolidating his power, using authority given him by the National Assembly to rule by decree. \\nBut he isn’t able to halt the decline in oil prices that pull down the Venezuelan economy with it.As Venezuela’s situation worsens, the Maduro regime arrests opposition political leaders and shuts down news websites and detains journalists, leading to criticism from the U.N. and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. In 2017, Venezuela’s Supreme Court, filled with Maduro loyalists, take away the powers of the National Assembly, increasing Maduro’s control. The following year, he is reelected overwhelmingly in an election that a coalition of other western hemisphere nations says “lacked legitimacy.”In January, opposition leader Guaido, head of the National Assembly, invokes the Venezuelan constitution to declare himself interim president, setting up a power struggle that is still yet to be resolved.\\n\\n\", 'external_id': None, 'error': False,
